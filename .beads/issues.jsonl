{"id":"saf-site-vitepress-33i","title":"PROJECT CONTEXT: VitePress POC for SAF Site","description":"## Project Overview\n\n**Goal**: Evaluate VitePress as replacement for Nuxt for MITRE SAF documentation site (open source version)\n\n**Why VitePress?**\n- Separate visual identity from commercial product (which uses Nuxt UI)\n- Avoid brand confusion between OSS and commercial offerings\n- Potentially better performance and simpler hosting (static site)\n- Built-in local search, good documentation tooling\n\n**Repository**: https://github.com/mitre/saf-site-vitepress\n**Original Nuxt repo**: `/Users/alippold/github/mitre/saf-site-v4`\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nThis POC needs to prove VitePress can handle:\n1. **Complex data management**: YAML-based profiles, hardening guides, standards\n2. **Interactive features**: Client-side filters, search, browse pages\n3. **Production-quality components**: Good defaults, accessible, maintainable\n4. **Static site generation**: Fast builds, good bundle size\n5. **Content architecture**: Same UX as Nuxt but simpler stack\n\n## High-Level Work Tracks\n\n### Track 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)\n- Establish layout patterns (doc vs page)\n- Choose component library (Reka UI vs Shadcn Vue)\n- Build reusable page layouts (home, browse, framework)\n- Set up data loaders for YAML content\n\n### Track 2: Content Migration\n- Copy YAML data from saf-site-v4\n- Create browse pages (validation, hardening, standards)\n- Generate individual detail pages\n- Migrate framework content (Plan, Harden, Validate, etc.)\n\n### Track 3: Production Evaluation\n- Build performance testing\n- Bundle size analysis\n- Search quality validation\n- Deployment strategy\n- Final decision: VitePress vs Nuxt\n\n## Key Constraints\n\n- **NO commercial product references** in code/docs/beads\n- Use hub-spoke pattern in beads (NOT markdown documentation files)\n- This is production evaluation, not just a POC throwaway\n- Component library choice is CRITICAL - affects all future work\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Framework**: VitePress 1.6.4\n- **Components**: Reka UI 2.7.0 (headless - may switch to Shadcn Vue)\n- **Data**: VitePress data loaders (build-time YAML processing)\n- **Styling**: VitePress default theme + MITRE branding\n- **Search**: VitePress built-in local search\n\n## Current Status\n\n**What's Working**:\n- Browse page with filters (validation profiles)\n- Full-width layout with proper typography\n- Client-side reactive filtering\n- MITRE branding colors\n\n**Pending Decisions**:\n- Component library (Reka UI issues with transparency)\n- Data loader implementation for real YAML\n- Home page design/layout\n\n**Next Major Milestone**: Complete all core layouts to evaluate feasibility","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-12T17:34:28.228194-05:00","created_by":"alippold","updated_at":"2026-01-12T17:34:28.228194-05:00"}
