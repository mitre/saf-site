## Personal Information We Collect

### Personal Information You Give Us

MITRE may obtain your personal information when you interact with our Site, for example, when you request information about our services using the "Contact Us" link or sign up for our news and information offerings. Personal information is data that identifies you, or could reasonably be used to identify you, as an individual, such as your name, postal address, email address, and phone number.

### Information We Collect Automatically

We also may collect other information about your visits to our Site using automated tools; for example, cookies and other passive information collection technologies enable MITRE to compile aggregate statistics concerning use of the Sites, analyze trends, enhance the security of the Site, deliver content, and otherwise administer and improve the Sites. This information may include your browser type, language preference, operating system, device identifier, device type, access time, Internet Protocol (IP) address, the URLs of websites you visited before and after visiting our Site, the web search that landed you on our Sites, length of your visits to our Sites, and the links you click and pages you visit within our Site.

Your web browser may have settings that allow you to transmit a "Do Not Track" signal when you visit various websites or use online services. Like many websites, our Sites are not designed to respond to "Do Not Track" signals received from browsers. To learn more about online tracking, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provides guidance on [How To Protect Your Privacy Online](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-protect-your-privacy-online).

Our site is hosted by GitHub®, which provides internet hosting for software development and version control. When GitHub is visited, the visitor's IP address is logged and stored for security purposes, regardless of whether the visitor has signed into GitHub or not. For more information about GitHub's privacy and security practices, see the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).

We use Google Analytics® to help us understand and analyze how visitors use our Site. For more information on how Google Analytics uses data collected through the Site, visit [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). To opt out of Google Analytics cookies, visit: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) and [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

## How We Use Personal Information

MITRE may use personal information we collect through our Sites to:

- communicate with you, including to respond to your questions and requests, send you notices about our services, or contact you for additional information when needed;
- analyze Site trends, usage, and the activities of Site visitors;
- improve our Site and notify you about important updates;
- perform internal business analyses or for other business purposes consistent with our mission;
- facilitate, manage, personalize, and improve our partnership relationships;
- identify, prevent, investigate, and take other actions with respect to suspected or actual fraud or illegal activity or other activity that violates our policies;
- ensure the security and integrity of our personal information processing;
- comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and legal processes as well as our company policies; and
- fulfill other purposes, with your consent (as required).

## How We Share Personal Information

MITRE may share your personal information within our organization, with our affiliates and business partners, and with our vendors and service providers. We also may share your personal information to:

- better respond to your inquiries;
- perform marketing research and for sales, support, and service-related purposes;
- protect rights, property, life, health, security, and safety;
- negotiate or complete any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, or any other type of acquisition or other transaction, including a transfer of all or a portion of our business to another organization;
- disclose personal information with your consent or at your direction; and

MITRE may disclose your personal information to comply with applicable law, such as in response to requests from law enforcement agencies, regulators, other public authorities, courts, and third-party litigants in connection with legal proceedings or investigations.

## Linked Websites

Our Site may include links to other websites that are not owned or operated by MITRE. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites, which may have their own privacy policies that you should review to understand how they may collect, use, or disclose your personal information. MITRE is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any linked websites that it does not control.

## Security of Personal Information

MITRE maintains reasonable safeguards designed to protect personal information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. MITRE employs encryption technologies and user authentication procedures that are designed to keep data secure. Nevertheless, transmission via the Internet and online digital storage are not completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

## Your Choices

You may receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or received services—such as a newsletter subscription—from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

You will have the ability to change your preferences or unsubscribe any time you receive an email from us. When you opt out of receiving a specific subscription or newsletter, this will not affect any other newsletters or subscriptions that you have requested. You can also ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at privacy@mitre.org.

## Information for Visitors from Australia

We are committed to handling your personal information in an open and transparent manner in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal data or our response to your request regarding your personal data, you may contact us at privacy@mitre.org or submit a complaint directly to the data protection authority in your jurisdiction. If you reside in the EEA, you can find information about your data protection authority [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). If you reside in the UK, you may file complaints with the Information Commissioner's Office [here](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/).

### Our Retention of Your Personal Data

MITRE retains your personal data for no longer than is necessary to achieve the purposes for which the personal data was collected, or as may otherwise be permitted or required under applicable law. To determine the appropriate retention period, we will consider the scope and sensitivity of the personal data; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized access to, use, or disclosure of the data; the purposes for which we process the data; whether we can achieve our purposes through other means; our business needs; and applicable legal requirements. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, at the end of the retention period, we will anonymize or securely destroy your personal data.

### Personal Data Transfers

By using the MITRE Sites, you acknowledge that your personal data may be collected, transferred to, and processed in jurisdictions outside your own. When you directly provide your personal data through our Sites, you acknowledge that your personal data is being provided by you to a company based in the United States. The laws that apply to personal data protection in the United States differ from those applicable in the EEA and the UK.

If it is necessary for us to transfer personal data out of the EEA and the UK, we do so by using suitable data transfer mechanisms, such as the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, which impose data protection obligations on parties to the transfer.

This Site is not intended for children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

We will indicate changes to this Privacy Policy by updating the "Effective Date" at the beginning of the Privacy Policy. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically and especially before you provide any personal information to us. Your continued use of this Site after any update to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of our changes.
