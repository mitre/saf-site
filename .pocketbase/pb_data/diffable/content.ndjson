This code is intended to help users assess their security posture on the GKE against the CIS Benchmark. This code is not certified by CIS.\n\n## Coverage\n\nThe benchmark contains of three [Inspec](https://www.inspec.io/) profiles which can be found in the subdirectories [inspec-gke-cis-gcp](inspec-gke-cis-gcp), [inspec-gke-cis-k8s](inspec-gke-cis-k8s) and [inspec-gke-cis-ssh](inspec-gke-cis-ssh). The profiles are separated, since each profile needs to run against a different target (`-t`) option when running `inspec exec`. Targets which are used:\n * inspec-gke-cis-gcp uses [inspec-gcp](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-gcp)\n * inspec-gke-cis-k8s uses [inspec-k8s](https://github.com/bgeesaman/inspec-k8s)\n * inspec-gke-cis-ssh uses the SSH protocol for remote access (requires root privileges).\n\nA wrapper script `run_profiles.sh` is provided in the root directory of the repository which executes all profiles sequentially and stores reports in a dedicated folder `/reports`. Note, that you need to configure access via the [Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-kubernetes-howto) to cluster nodes for this script to run successfully.\n\n## Prerequisites\n* Configure access via the [Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-kubernetes-howto) to cluster nodes for the inspec-gke-cis-ssh profile to run successfully\n* Follow the setup steps for inspec-k8s as explained [here](https://github.com/bgeesaman/train-kubernetes#installation)\n\n### CLI Example (Cloud Shell)\n\n```\n# install inspec (later version might work but not tested)\n$ gem install inspec-bin -v 4.41.2 --no-document --quiet\n\n# clone the Git Repo\n$ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/inspec-gke-cis-benchmark.git\n$ cd inspec-gke-cis-benchmark\n\n# Write an inputs file, see basic example below\n$ cat <<EOF > inputs.yml\ngcp_project_id: \"<YOUR PROJECT ID>\"\ngcp_gke_locations:\n - 'us-central1-c'\ngce_zones:\n - 'us-central1'\n - 'us-central1-c'\nEOF\n\n# Connect to GKE Cluster (getting credentials in ~/.kubeconfig, validate using kubectl)\n$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster name> \\\n  --zone <zone> --project <YOUR PROJECT ID>\n\n# install inspec-k8s and relevant gems (needs to run in directory of Gemfile)\n# (refer to the inspec-k8s docs for details and troubleshooting)\n$ bundle install\n\n# install InSpec plugin train-kubernetes\n$ inspec plugin install train-kubernetes\n\n# Add the host you are running from to the master-authorized-networks to allow access to Private K8S Clusters\n$ gcloud container clusters update <cluster name> \\\n  --zone <zone> \\\n  --enable-master-authorized-networks \\\n  --master-authorized-networks <your host's IP address>/32\n\n\n```\n\n```\n# make sure you're authenticated to GCP\n$ gcloud auth list\n\n# acquire credentials to use with Application Default Credentials\n$ gcloud auth application-default login\n\n```\n\n```\n# Create a file inputs.yml which contains the required and optional inputs to the profiles in the subdirectories\n$ ./run_profiles.sh -c <cluster name> -u <ssh user> -k <keyfile path> -z <cluster zone> -i inputs.yml\n```\n\n### Profile Inputs (combined across all profiles)\n\n* **gcp_project_id** - (Default: \"\", type: string) - The target GCP Project that must be specified.\n* **gcp_gke_locations** - (Default: \"\", type: array) - The list of regions and/or zone names where GKE clusters are running. An empty array searches all locations\n* **gce_zones** - (Default: \"\", type: array) - The list of zone names where GCE instances are running. An empty array searches all locations.\n* **registry_storage_admin_list** - (Default: \"\", type: array) - The allowed list of Storage Admins on Registry image bucket\n* **registry_storage_object_admin_list** - (Default: \"\", type: array) - The allowed list of Storage Object Admins on Registry image bucket\n* **registry_storage_object_creator_list** - (Default: \"\", type: array) - The allowed list of Storage Object Admins on Registry image bucket\n* **registry_storage_object_creator_list** - (Default: \"\", type: array) - The allowed list of Storage Object Creators on Registry image bucket\n* **registry_storage_legacy_bucket_owner_list** - (Default: \"\", type: array) - The allowed list of Storage Legacy Bucket Owners on Registry image bucket\n* **registry_storage_legacy_bucket_writer_list** - (Default: \"\", type: array) - The allowed list of Storage Legacy Bucket Writers on Registry image bucket\n* **registry_storage_legacy_object_owner_list** - (Default: \"\", type: array) - The allowed list of Storage Legacy Object Owners on Registry image bucket\n* **client_ca_file_path** - (Default: \"/etc/srv/kubernetes/pki/ca-certificates.crt\", type: string) - Path to the client ca file used in Kubelet config\n* **event_record_qps** - (Default: \"0\", type: string) - --event-qps flag of Kubelet config (see control 3.2.9)\n* **tls_cert_file** - (Default: \"\", type: string) - Location of the certificate file to use to identify the Kubelet\n* **tls_private_key_file** - (Default: \"\", type: string) - Location of the corresponding private key file to use to identify the Kubelet\n\n### Cloud Shell Walkthrough\n\nUse this Cloud Shell walkthrough for a hands-on example.\n\n[![Open this project in Cloud Shell](http://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/inspec-gke-cis-benchmark&page=editor&tutorial=walkthrough.md)\n\n### Required Permissions\n\nThe following permissions are required to run the CIS benchmark profile on project level:\n\n* compute.regions.list\n* compute.zones.list\n* container.clusters.get\n* container.clusters.list\n* serviceusage.services.get\n* storage.buckets.get\n* storage.buckets.getIamPolicy\n"]

Future Oracle Database 19c critical patch updates (CPUs) may impact the recommendations included in this document.\n\nFor more information see [CIS Benchmarks FAQ](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/cis-benchmarks-faq)\n\nThis InSpec profile automates the validation of Oracle Database 19c against the equivalent CIS Benchmark.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Requirements\n\n#### Oracle 19c  \n- Oracle 19c Database\n- An account with at least SYSTEM-level role access to run SQL commands\n\n#### Required software on InSpec Runner\n- [InSpec](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-inspec/)\n\n#### Required software on target of evaluation\n- [SQL\\*Plus](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/qstart.htm)\n    - Release 19c\n\n### Setup Environment on Oracle Database machine \n#### Install InSpec\nGoto https://www.inspec.io/downloads/ and consult the documentation for your Operating System to download and install InSpec.\n\n#### Ensure InSpec version is most recent ( > 4.23.X )\n```sh\ninspec --version\n```\n\n### How to execute this instance  \nThis profile can be executed against a remote target using the ssh transport, docker transport, or winrm transport of InSpec. Profiles can also be executed directly on the host where InSpec is installed (see https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/). \n\n#### Required Inputs\nYou must specify inputs in an `inputs.yml` file. See `example_inputs.yml` in the profile root folder for a sample. Each input is required for proper execution of the profile.\n```yaml\nuser: 'SYSTEM'\npassword: 'password'\nhost: '127.0.0.1'\nservice: 'ORCLCDB'\nsqlplus_bin: 'sqlplus'\nlistener_file: /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/listener.ora\nmultitenant: false\nversion: '19.0.0.0.0'\nlisteners: ['LISTENER']\n```\nSome default values have been added to `inspec.yml`, but can be overridden by defining new values in `inputs.yml`. No default values have been given for database-specific connection variables like the password or the service name; these must be specified in the input file.\n##### Note\nEnvironment variables will not be interpreted correctly in `inputs.yml` or `inspec.yml`.\nExample:\n```\nlistener_file: $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora # $ORACLE_HOME will not be expanded out correctly!\n```\n#### Execute a single control in the profile \n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile on runner> --input-file=inputs.yml --controls=oracle19c-1.1 -t <target>\n```\n#### Execute a single control in the profile and save results as JSON\n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile on runner> --input-file=inputs.yml --controls=<control id> -t <target> --reporter cli json:results.json\n```\n#### Execute all controls in the profile \n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile on runner> --input-file=inputs.yml -t <target>\n```\n#### Execute all controls in the profile and save results as JSON\n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile on runner> --input-file=inputs.yml -t <target> --reporter cli json:results.json\n```\n#### Execute the profile directly on the Oracle database host\n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile on the host> --input-file=inputs.yml --reporter cli json:results.json\n```\n"]

InSpec supports the following standard AWS variables:\n\n- `AWS_REGION`\n- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\n- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`\n- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional) - required if MFA is enabled\n\n### Notes on MFA\n\nIn any AWS MFA enabled environment, you will need to use `derived credentials` to use the CLI. Your default `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` will not satisfy the MFA Policies in AWS environments.\n\n- The AWS documentation is here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-session-token.html\n- The AWS profile documentation is here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html\n- A useful bash script for automating this is here: https://gist.github.com/dinvlad/d1bc0a45419abc277eb86f2d1ce70625\n\nTo generate credentials using an AWS Profile you will need to use the following AWS CLI commands.\n\na. `aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::<$YOUR-MFA-SERIAL> --token-code <$YOUR-CURRENT-MFA-TOKEN> --profile=<$YOUR-AWS-PROFILE>`\n\nb. Then export the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` that was generated by the above command.\n\n## Profile Inputs\n\nThis profile uses InSpec Inputs to make the tests more flexible. You are able to provide inputs at runtime either via the cli or via YAML files to help the profile work best in your deployment.\n\n### **_Do not change the inputs in the `inspec.yml` file_**\n\nThe `inputs` defined in the `inspec.yml` file are the shared inputs for the **profile and defaults for the profile**.\n\nInSpec provides two (2) ways for the **user to adjust the profiles inputs at run-time**. Automated profiles frequently run from a script, inside a pipeline or some kind of task scheduler.\n\nSuch automation usually works by running the profile directly from its source (i.e. this repository), which means the runner will not have access to the `inspec.yml`.\n\n### Providing `input` values to the Profile from the CLI or Local File\n\n1. Via the cli with the `--input` flag\n2. Pass them in a YAML file with the `--input-file` flag.\n\nMore information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Inputs Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/inputs/).\n\n### Creating your taylored `my_inputs.yml`\n\nYou `should review` all the shared inputs in the `inspec.yml` file to know what inputs you can use to better direct how, what and where the profile tests your AWS environment.\n\nAn example `my_inputs.yml` file, recorded in YAML format, is given below, with comments to explain the purpose of each input and which controls it is used in (note that '[]' represents an empty list in YAML format).\n\n```yaml\n# Flag to disable some of the longer-running controls (do not enable in production)\n# controls disabled by this flag: 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.12, 1.14, 5.1,

This repo is now in archive mode, but still accessible. For more information about SAF with current links, see https://security.cms.gov/learn/security-automation-framework-saf**\n\n\nA minimal baseline to scan for all packages that have known CVE (cve.mitre.org) patchable vulnerabilities on your red hat system.\n\n# Description\n\nThis [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) compliance profile uses `yum updateinfo list cves` command to list all packages that have known cve.mitre.org patchable vulnerabilities.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) at least version 2.*\n- `yum` must be configured correctly on the target.\n\n## Get started\n\n### Installing InSpec \n\nIf needed - install inspec on your 'runner' system - i.e. your orchestration server, your workstation, your bastion host or your instance you wish to evlauate.\n\n  a. InSpec has prepackaged installers for all platforms here: https://www.inspec.io/downloads, or \n  \n  b. If you already have a ruby environment (`2.4.x`) installed on your 'runner' system - you can just do a simple `gem install inspec`, or \n  \n  c. If running in AWS, you can use the AWS SSM suite to run InSpec on your RHEL assets - see the InSpec + SSM documation here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/using-aws-systems-manager-to-run-compliance-scans-using-inspec-by-chef/\n  \n### Get the RHEL CVE Vulunrability Scan Profile\n\nYou will need to download the InSpec Profile to your `runner` system. You can do this via `git` or the GitHub Web interface, etc.\n\n  a. `git clone https://github.cms.gov/ispg-review/rhel_cve_vulnerability_scan_baseline`, or \n  \n  b. Save a Zip or tar.gz copy of the master branch from the `Clone or Download` button of this project\n\n### Setting up dependencies in your Ruby and InSpec Environments\n\nThe profile uses Bundler to manage needed dependencies - so you will need to installed the needed gems via bundler before you run the profile. Change directories to your your cloned inspec profile then do a `bundle install`. \n\n  a. `cd rhel_cve_vulnerability_scan_baseline` \n  \n  b. `bundle install`\n\n## Usage\n\nInSpec makes it easy to run your tests wherever you need. More options listed here: [InSpec cli](http://inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/)\n\n```\n# Clone Inspec Profile\n$ git clone https://github.cms.gov/ispg-review/rhel_cve_vulnerability_scan_baseline\n\n# Install Gems\n$ bundle install\n\n# To run profile locally with cli & json output \n$ inspec exec /path/to/profile --attrs=attributes.yml --reporter cli json:cve_scan-results.json --sudo\n\n# To run profile on a remote target with cli & json output \n$ inspec exec /path/to/profile -t ssh://username@target-ip -i path/to/ssh-cert --reporter cli json:cve_scan-results.json --sudo\n\n```\nFor more usage options, see https://github.com/chef/inspec/blob/master/README.md \n\n\n## Contributors + Kudos\n\n- Aaron Lippold [aaronlippold](https://github.com/aaronlippold)\n- Rony Xavier [rx294](https://github.com/rx294)\n- Eugene Aronne [ejaronne](https://github.com/ejaronne)\n\n### License \n\n* This project is dual-licensed under the terms of the Apache license 2.0 (apache-2.0)\n"]

This [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) compliance profile verifies that you do not have any insecure or publicly accessible S3 buckets or bucket objects in your AWS environment in an automated way.\n\n## Required Gems\n\nThis profile requires the following gems:\n\n- `inspec` (v5 or higher)\n- `inspec-bin` (v5 or higher)\n- `aws-sdk-s3` (v2 or higher, v3 recommended)\n- `concurrent-ruby` (v1.1.0 or higher)\n\nPlease **install these gems** in the Ruby environment that InSpec is using before executing the profile.\n\n### Large Buckets and Profile Runtime\n\nThe `public-s3-bucket-objects` control - and its support library `list_public_s3_objects` - iterates through every object in each bucket in your AWS environment. The runtime will depend on the number of objects in your S3 buckets.\n\nOn average, the profile can process around ~1000 objects/sec.\n\nIf you have buckets with a large number of objects, we suggest scripting a loop and using the `single_bucket` input to parallelize the workload, or you can use the `test_buckets` input to provide an array of buckets to test.\n\n## Profile Inputs\n\n- `single_bucket`: The name of the single bucket you wish to scan. This input is useful for testing a specific bucket.\n- `exempt_buckets`: A list of buckets that should be exempted from review. This input allows you to skip certain buckets from being tested.\n- `test_buckets`: A list of buckets to test. This input allows you to specify multiple buckets to be tested.\n- `list_public_s3_objects_params`: A hash of parameters for the `list_public_s3_objects` function. This input allows you to configure the following parameters:\n  - `thread_pool_size`: The size of the thread pool for concurrent processing. Default is 50. Increasing this value can improve performance for buckets with a large number of objects by allowing more concurrent processing, but it may also increase the load on your system.\n  - `batch_size`: The number of objects to process in each batch. Default is 200. Adjusting this value can affect the balance between memory usage and processing speed.\n  - `max_retries`: The maximum number of retries for S3 requests. Default is 5. This can help handle transient errors but may increase the overall runtime if set too high.\n  - `retry_delay`: The delay between retries in seconds. Default is 0.5. This can help handle transient errors by spacing out retry attempts.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\n- **Threading and Concurrency**: The `thread_pool_size` parameter controls the number of concurrent threads used to process objects. Increasing this value can improve performance by allowing more objects to be processed simultaneously, but it may also increase the load on your system and potentially lead to throttling by AWS.\n- **Batch Processing**: The `batch_size` parameter controls the number of objects processed in each batch. Larger batch sizes can reduce the number of API calls to AWS, but they may also increase memory usage.\n- **Retries and Delays**: The `max_retries` and `retry_delay` parameters control how the function handles transient errors. Increasing the number of retries and the delay between retries can improve the robustness of the function but may also increase the overall runtime.\n\nTo see the processing in more detail, use the `-l debug` flag to get verbose output.\n\nYou can then load all your HDF JSON results into [Heimdall Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org) to easily review all your scan results from multiple runs by loading them in Heimdall.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIt is intended and recommended that InSpec and this profile be run from a **\"runner\"** host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely using **AWS CLI**.\n\n**For the best security of the runner, always install the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components on the runner.**\n\nThe latest versions and installation options are available on the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.\n\nThis baseline also requires the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), which is available on the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) site.\n\n### Getting MFA Aware AWS Access, Secret, and Session Tokens\n\nYou need to ensure that your AWS CLI environment has the correct system environment variables set with your AWS region, credentials, and session token to use the AWS CLI and InSpec resources in the AWS environment. InSpec supports the following standard AWS variables:\n\n- `AWS_REGION`\n- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\n- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`\n- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional) - required if MFA is enabled\n\n### Notes on MFA\n\nIn any AWS MFA-enabled environment, you need to use `derived credentials` to use the CLI. Your default `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` will not satisfy the MFA Policies in AWS environments.\n\nThe AWS documentation is available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-session-token.html).\n\nThe AWS profile documentation is available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html).\n\nA useful bash script for automating this is available [here](https://gist.github.com/dinvlad/d1bc0a45419abc277eb86f2d1ce70625).\n\nTo generate credentials using an AWS Profile, you will need to use the following AWS CLI commands:\n\na. `aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::<$YOUR-MFA-SERIAL> --token-code <$YOUR-CURRENT-MFA-TOKEN> --profile=<$YOUR-AWS-PROFILE>`\n\nb. Then export the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` that were generated by the above command.\n\n## Tailoring to Your Environment\n\nThe following inputs must be configured in an inputs \".yml\" file for the profile to run correctly in your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).\n\n```yaml\n# List of buckets exempted from inspection.\nexception_bucket_list:\n    - bucket1\n    - bucket2\n    ...\n\n# Test only one bucket\nsingle_bucket: 'my-bucket'\n\n# Test specific buckets\ntest_buckets:\n    - bucket3\n    - bucket4\n    ...\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n```bash\n# Set required ENV variables as per your environment\n\n$ export AWS_REGION=us-east-1\n$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...\n$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...\n$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=... # if MFA is enabled\n```\n\n## Installing the Needed Gems\n\n### Plain Old Ruby Environment\n\n- `gem install concurrent-ruby`\n\n### Using a Chef or CINC Omnibus Installation\n\n- `chef gem install concurrent-ruby`\n\n## Running This Baseline Directly from GitHub\n\n### Testing all your buckets except those defined in your `excluded buckets`\n\n`inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-s3-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target aws:// --input-file=your_inputs_file.yml --reporter=cli json:your_output_file.json`\n\n### Testing a single bucket\n\n`inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-s3-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target aws:// --input single_bucket=your_bucket --reporter=cli json:your_output_file.json`\n\n### Testing specific buckets\n\n`inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-s3-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target aws:// --input-file=your_inputs_file.yml --reporter=cli json:your_output_file.json`\n\n### Different Run Options\n\n[Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)\n\n## Running This Baseline from a Local Archive Copy\n\nIf your runner does not always have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this baseline and all its dependent tests:\n\n(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below.

CINC Auditor and InSpec are built from the same source code and function identically, but CINC Auditor requires no license to use (which means it also does not come with any expectation of support from Chef).\n\nFor more information see [CINC Home](https://cinc.sh/)\n\nIt is intended and recommended that CINC Auditor and this profile executed from a **\"runner\"** host\n(such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop)\nagainst the target. This can be any Unix/Linux/MacOS or Windows runner host, with access to the Internet.\n\n> [TIP]\n> **For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the latest version of CINC Auditor and any other supporting language components.**\n\nTo install CINC Auditor on a UNIX/Linux/MacOS platform use the following command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P cinc-auditor\n```\n\nTo install CINC Auditor on a Windows platform (PowerShell) use the following command:\n\n```powershell\n. { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.ps1 } | iex; install -project cinc-auditor\n```\n\nTo confirm successful install of CINC Auditor:\n\n```bash\ncinc-auditor -v\n```\n\nLatest versions and other installation options are available at [CINC Auditor](https://cinc.sh/start/auditor/)'s website.\n\n### Intended Usage\n\n1. The latest `released` version of the profile is intended for use in A&A testing, as well as\n   providing formal results to Authorizing Officials and Identity and Access Management (IAM)s.\n   Please use the `released` versions of the profile in these types of workflows.\n\n2. The `main` branch is a development branch that will become the next release of the profile.\n   The `main` branch is intended for use in *developing and testing* merge requests for the next\n   release of the profile, and *is not intended* be used for formal and ongoing testing on systems.\n\n### Tailoring to Your Environment\n\nThis profile uses InSpec Inputs to provide flexibility during testing. Inputs allow for\ncustomizing the behavior of Chef InSpec profiles.\n\nInSpec Inputs are defined in the `inspec.yml` file. The `inputs` configured in this\nfile are **profile definitions and defaults for the profile** extracted from the profile\nguidances and contain metadata that describe the profile, and shouldn't be modified.\n\nInSpec provides several methods for customizing profile behaviors at run-time that does not require\nmodifying the `inspec.yml` file itself (see [Using Customized Inputs](#using-customized-inputs)).\n\nThe following inputs are permitted to be configured in an inputs `.yml` file (often named inputs.yml)\nfor the profile to run correctly on a specific environment, while still complying with the security\nguidance document intent. This is important to prevent confusion when test results are passed downstream\nto different stakeholders under the *security guidance name used by this profile repository*\n\nFor changes beyond the inputs cited in this section, users can create an *organizationally-named overlay repository*.\nFor more information on developing overlays, reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre-saf-training.netlify.app/courses/beginner/10.html)\n\n#### Example of tailoring Inputs *While Still Complying* with the security guidance document for the profile\n\n> [NOTE]\n> Inputs are variables that are referenced by control(s) in the profile that implement them.\n> They are declared (defined) and given a default value in the `inspec.yml` file.\n\n#### Using Customized Inputs\n\nCustomized inputs may be used at the CLI by providing an input file or a flag at execution time.\n\n1. Using the `--input` flag\n\n   Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input disable_slow_controls=true`\n\n2. Using the `--input-file` flag.\n\n   Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input-file=<my_inputs_file.yml>`\n\n> [TIP]\n> For additional information about `input` file examples reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre.github.io/saf-training/courses/beginner/06.html#input-file-example)\n\nChef InSpec Resources:\n\n- [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/)\n- [InSpec Inputs](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inputs/)\n- [inspec.yml](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inspec_yml/)\n\n### Testing the Profile Controls\n\nThe Gemfile provided contains all the necessary ruby dependencies for checking the profile controls.\n\n#### Requirements\n\nAll action are conducted using `ruby` (gemstone/programming language). Currently `inspec`\ncommands have been tested with ruby version 3.1.2. A higher version of ruby is not guaranteed to\nprovide the expected results. Any modern distribution of Ruby comes with Bundler preinstalled by default.\n\nInstall ruby based on the OS being used, see [Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)\n\nAfter installing `ruby` install the necessary dependencies by invoking the bundler command\n(must be in the same directory where the Gemfile is located):\n\n```bash\nbundle install\n```\n\n#### Testing Commands\n\nLinting and validating controls:\n\n```bash\nbundle exec rake [inspec or cinc-auditor]:check # Validate the InSpec Profile\nbundle exec rake lint                            # Run RuboCop Linter\nbundle exec rake lint:auto_correct       # Autocorrect RuboCop offenses (only when it's safe)\nbundle exec rake pre_commit_checks  # Pre-commit checks\n```\n\nEnsure the controls are ready to be committed into the repo:\n\n```bash\nbundle exec rake pre_commit_checks\n```\n\n## Setting up the Profile\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**\n\n    Start by cloning the `azure-foundations-cis-baseline` repository from GitHub to your local machine:\n\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/mitre/azure-foundations-cis-baseline.git\n    cd azure-foundations-cis-baseline\n    ```\n\n2. **Clone the Repository**\n\n    Once the repository is cloned, install the required Ruby dependencies by running:\n\n    ```sh\n    bundle install\n    ```\n\n3. **Create and Update `inputs.yml` for Inspec**\n\n   Execute the following command to create the `inputs.yml` file by copying `inputs_template.yml` and renaming it to `inputs.yml`.\n   Update this file with your values.\n\n   ```sh\n   cp inputs_template.yml inputs.yml\n   ```\n\n### Example `inputs.yml`\n\nThe [inputs_template.yml](https://github.com/mitre/azure-foundations-cis-baseline/blob/main/inputs_template.yml) file offers a comprehensive template that outlines all the required inputs for this profile, complete with detailed descriptions for each input.\n\n## Running the Profile\n\n### Execute All Controls in the Profile\n\n```sh\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec . --enhanced-outcomes  --input-file=inputs.yml\n```\n\n#### Execute All the Controls in the Profile and Save Results as Json\n\n```sh\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec . --enhanced-outcomes  --reporter json:results.json --input-file=inputs.yml\n```\n\n### Execute a Single Control and Save Results as Json\n\nReplace [control-number] with the actual control number (e.g., use 5.1.6 to target azure-foundations-cis-5.1.6)\n\n```sh\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec . --enhanced-outcomes  --reporter json:results.json --input-file=inputs.yml --controls=azure-foundations-cis-[control-number]\n```\n\n### Different Run Options\n\n[Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)\n\n## Attesting the Profile\n\n1. **Create the Attestation File**\n\n    You can create an attestation file by copying the provided template. Run the following command to copy `attestation_template.json` and rename it to `attestation.json`:\n\n    ```sh\n    cp attestation_template.json attestation.json\n    ```\n\n    Alternatively, if you prefer an interactive approach, use the SAF CLI to guide you through the creation process. For detailed instructions, refer to the [SAF CLI documentation](https://saf-cli.mitre.org/#attest).\n\n2. **Apply the Attestation**\n\n    Once you have your `attestation.json` ready, apply the attestation with the following command:\n\n    ```sh\n    saf attest apply -i attestation.json results.json -o results_attested.json\n    ```\n\n## Using Heimdall for Viewing Test Results\n\nThe JSON results output file can be loaded into **[Heimdall-Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)**\nor **[Heimdall-Server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)** for a user-interactive, graphical view of the profile scan results.\n\nHeimdall-Lite is a `browser only` viewer that allows you to easily view your results directly and locally rendered in your browser.\nHeimdall-Server is configured with a `data-services backend` allowing for data persistency to a database (PostgreSQL).\nFor more detail on feature capabilities see [Heimdall Features](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2?tab=readme-ov-file#features)\n\nHeimdall can ***export your results into a DISA Checklist (CKL) file*** for easily uploading into eMass using the `Heimdall Export` function.\n\nDepending on your environment restrictions, the [SAF CLI](https://saf-cli.mitre.org) can be used to run a local docker instance\nof Heimdall-Lite via the `saf view:heimdall` command.\n\nAdditionally both Heimdall applications can be deployed via docker, kubernetes, or the installation packages.\n\n## Check Overview\n\n### Azure Services\n\nThis profile requires the following Azure services to be properly configured in order to run effectively.\n\n- App Services\n- Azure CosmosDB\n- Azure Database for MySQL flexible servers\n- Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible servers\n- Azure SQL\n- Bastions\n- Microsoft Defender for Cloud\n- Microsoft Entra ID\n- Key Vaults\n- Log Analytics workspaces\n- Network Watcher\n- Storage Accounts\n\n### Control and Automation Status\n\nNot all controls in the CIS Benchmark are capable of automated assessment. The table below marks which controls are automated and which ones are manual.\n\n| Number  | Description                                                                                                                                                    | Automatable                | Implementation           |\n| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| 2       | Identity                                                                                                                                                       | -

Please see the documentation below on how to use the framework. \n\n# Testing with Kitchen\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Ruby 2.3.0 or later\n- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org)\n- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)\n\n#### _Notes to Windows Users_\n\n1. An installation of ChefDK may generate conflicts when combined with the\n   installed kitchen gems. **Recommend NOT installing ChefDK before testing\n   with this repo.**\n\n2. If you run into errors when running `bundle install`, use the following\n   commands to install gems:\n\n- `gem install kitchen-ansible`\n- `gem install kitchen-vagrant`\n\n3. If the tests are not found when running `kitchen verify`, open\n   `.kitchen.yml` and consult `inspec_tests` under the `suites` section.\n\n4) You may also experience an error when running `kitchen converge` where a\n   folder is unable to be created due to the length of the path. In this case,\n   you may need to edit a registry key as explained\n   [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/266621/how-to-make-windows-10-accept-file-paths-over-260-characters/).\n\n## Setting up your box\n\n1. Clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline/main.git`\n2. cd to `redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline`\n3. Run `bundle install`\n4. Run `kitchen list` - you should see the following choice:\n   - `vanilla-rhel-7`\n   - `hardened-rhel-7`\n5. Run `kitchen converge`\n6. Run `kitchen list` - your should see your host with status \"converged\"\n7. RUn `kitchen verify` to execute inspec profiles against target\n\n# Hardening Development\n\nIncluded in this repository are testing scripts which allow you to run the profile using Vagrant or EC2 VMs. You can choose which environment your VMs are run in by passing the appropriate test-kitchen `yml` file to your `KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML` environment variable. All of the commands below use the `kitchen.vagrant.yml` file as an example, however a `kitchen.ec2.yaml` is also available in the repository and can be substituted below to run the tests in EC2.\n\n- Making Changes and Testing\n\n  - run `CHEF_LICENSE=accept KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=kitchen.vagrant.yml kitchen converge (machine name)` - runs any changes to your hardening scripts\n  - run `kitchen verify (machine name)` - runs the inspec tests\n\n- Starting Clean:\n  - run `CHEF_LICENSE=accept KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=kitchen.vagrant.yml kitchen destroy (machine name)` kitchen will drop your box and you can start clean\n- Going through the entire process ( create, build, configure, verify, destroy )\n  - run `CHEF_LICENSE=accept KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=kitchen.vagrant.yml kitchen test (machine name)` or to test all defined machines `kitchen test`\n- Just running the validation scripts\n  - run `CHEF_LICENSE=accept KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=kitchen.vagrant.yml kitchen verify (machine name)`\n- Just run one or more controls in the validation\n  - edit the kitchen.yml file in the `controls:` section add the `control id(s)` to the list\n- Skipping one or more tags in the hardening content \n  - run `CHEF_LICENSE=accept KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=kitchen.vagrant.yml ANSIBLE_EXTRA_FLAGS='--skip-tags=(tags)' kitchen converge (machine name)` kitchen will skip the tasks in the hardening script specified with the tags. \n\n### NOTICE\n\n© 2018-2022 The MITRE Corporation.\n\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Domain Controller Controls are include in this Profile\n    \n    There are 7 Controls that Require the Profile be ran against a Domain controller. These Controls check for User Accounts that are on the domain and require restrictions. List below are these controls:\n\n    - V-1112 - Outdated or unused accounts must be removed from the system or disabled.\n    - V-6840 - Windows 2012/2012 R2 passwords must be configured to expire.\n    - V-7002 - Windows 2012/2012 R2 accounts must be configured to require passwords.\n    - V-14225 - Windows 2012/2012 R2 password for the built-in Administrator account must be changed at least annually or when a member of the administrative team leaves the organization.\n    - V-36662 - Windows 2012/2012 R2 manually managed application account passwords must be changed at least annually or when a system administrator with knowledge of the password leaves the organization.\n    - V-57653 - If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be used to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts must be set upon account creation.\n    - V-57655 - Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts which are established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.\n\n\n### NOTICE\n\n© 2018-2020 The MITRE Corporation.\n\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

These guidelines are the primary security standards\nused by the DoD agencies. In addition to defining security guidelines, the STIGs also stipulate\nhow security training should proceed and when security checks should occur. Organizations must\nstay compliant with these guidelines or they risk having their access to the DoD terminated.\n\nRequirements associated with the Microsoft Windows 10 STIG are derived from the\n[Security Requirements Guides](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_requirements_guide)\nand align to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST)\n[Special Publication (SP) 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#!/800-53)\nSecurity Controls, [DoD Control Correlation Identifier](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/) and related standards.\n\nThe Microsoft Windows 10 STIG profile checks were developed to provide technical implementation\nvalidation to the defined DoD requirements, the guidance can provide insight for any organizations wishing\nto enhance their security posture and can be tailored easily for use in your organization.\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Getting Started  \n### InSpec (CINC-auditor) setup\nFor maximum flexibility/accessibility `cinc-auditor`, the open-source packaged binary version of Chef InSpec should be used,\ncompiled by the CINC (CINC Is Not Chef) project in coordination with Chef using Chef's always-open-source InSpec source code.\nFor more information see [CINC Home](https://cinc.sh/)\n\nIt is intended and recommended that CINC-auditor and this profile executed from a __\"runner\"__ host\n(such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop)\nagainst the target. This can be any Unix/Linux/MacOS or Windows runner host, with access to the Internet.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> **For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the latest version of CINC-auditor and any other supporting language components.**\n\nTo install CINC-auditor on a UNIX/Linux/MacOS platform use the following command:\n```bash\ncurl -L https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P cinc-auditor\n```\n\nTo install CINC-auditor on a Windows platform (Powershell) use the following command:\n```powershell\n. { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.ps1 } | iex; install -project cinc-auditor\n```\n\nTo confirm successful install of cinc-auditor:\n```\ncinc-auditor -v\n```\n\nLatest versions and other installation options are available at [CINC Auditor](https://cinc.sh/start/auditor/) site.\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n### Intended Usage\n1. The latest `released` version of the profile is intended for use in A&A testing, as well as\n    providing formal results to Authorizing Officials and Identity and Access Management (IAM)s.\n    Please use the `released` versions of the profile in these types of workflows. \n\n2. The `main` branch is a development branch that will become the next release of the profile.\n    The `main` branch is intended for use in _developing and testing_ merge requests for the next\n    release of the profile, and _is not intended_ be used for formal and ongoing testing on systems.\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n### Tailoring to Your Environment\nThis profile uses InSpec Inputs to provide flexibility during testing. Inputs allow for\ncustomizing the behavior of Chef InSpec profiles.\n\nInSpec Inputs are defined in the `inspec.yml` file. The `inputs` configured in this\nfile are **profile definitions and defaults for the profile** extracted from the profile\nguidances and contain metadata that describe the profile, and shouldn't be modified.\n\nInSpec provides several methods for customizing profile behaviors at run-time that does not require\nmodifying the `inspec.yml` file itself (see [Using Customized Inputs](#using-customized-inputs)).\n\nThe following inputs are permitted to be configured in an inputs `.yml` file (often named inputs.yml)\nfor the profile to run correctly on a specific environment, while still complying with the security\nguidance document intent. This is important to prevent confusion when test results are passed downstream\nto different stakeholders under the *security guidance name used by this profile repository*\n\nFor changes beyond the inputs cited in this section, users can create an *organizationally-named overlay repository*.\nFor more information on developing overlays, reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre-saf-training.netlify.app/courses/beginner/10.html)\n\n#### Example of tailoring Inputs *While Still Complying* with the security guidance document for the profile:\n\n```yaml\n  # This file specifies the attributes for the configurable controls\n  # used by the Microsoft Windows 10 STIG profile.\n\n  # Disable controls that are known to consistently have long run times\n  disable_slow_controls: [true or false]\n\n  # A unique list of administrative users\n  admins_list: [admin1, admin2, admin3]\n\n  # List of configuration files for the specific system\n  logging_conf_files: [\n    <dir-path-1>/*.conf\n    <dir-path-2>/*.conf\n  ]\n  \n  ...\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>Inputs are variables that are referenced by control(s) in the profile that implement them.\n They are declared (defined) and given a default value in the `inspec.yml` file. \n\n#### Profile minimal inputs requirement\nThe following inputs must be configured in an inputs \".yml\" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. \n\n```yaml\n  - set to either the string \"true\" or \"false\"\n  sensitive_system: false\n\n  - add your usernames as needed\n  backup_operators: (NULL)\n\n  - add your usernames as needed\n  administrators: (NULL)\n\n  - add your usernames as needed\n  hyper_v_admin: (NULL)\n\n  - add your AV Software Product to this list\n  av_approved_software: <List of AV Software>\n```\n\n#### Using Customized Inputs\nCustomized inputs may be used at the CLI by providing an input file or a flag at execution time.\n\n1. Using the `--input` flag\n  \n    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input disable_slow_controls=true`\n\n2. Using the `--input-file` flag.\n    \n    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input-file=<my_inputs_file.yml>`\n\n>[!TIP]\n> For additional information about `input` file examples reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre.github.io/saf-training/courses/beginner/06.html#input-file-example)\n\nChef InSpec Resources:\n- [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/).\n- [InSpec Inputs](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inputs/).\n- [inspec.yml](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inspec_yml/).\n\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n### Testing the Profile Controls\nThe Gemfile provided contains all the necessary ruby dependencies for checking the profile controls.\n#### Requirements\nAll action are conducted using `ruby` (gemstone/programming language). Currently `inspec` \ncommands have been tested with ruby version 3.1.2. A higher version of ruby is not guaranteed to\nprovide the expected results. Any modern distribution of Ruby comes with Bundler preinstalled by default.\n\nInstall ruby based on the OS being used, see [Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)\n\nAfter installing `ruby` install the necessary dependencies by invoking the bundler command\n(must be in the same directory where the Gemfile is located):\n```bash\nbundle install\n```\n\n#### Testing Commands\n\nLinting and validating controls:\n```bash\n  bundle exec rake [inspec or cinc-auditor]:check # Validate the InSpec Profile\n  bundle exec rake lint                           # Run RuboCop Linter\n  bundle exec rake lint:auto_correct              # Autocorrect RuboCop offenses (only when it's safe)\n  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks              # Pre-commit checks\n```\n\nEnsure the controls are ready to be committed into the repo:\n```bash\n  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks\n```\n\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Running the Profile\n### Directly from Github\nThis option is best used when network connectivity is available and policies permit\naccess to the hosting repository.\n\n```bash\n# Using `ssh` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec https://github.com/mitre/microsoft-windows-10-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter=cli json:<your_results_file.json>\n\n# Using `winrm` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec https://github.com/mitre/microsoft-windows-10-stig-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n### Using a local Archive copy\nIf your runner is not always expected to have direct access to the profile's hosted location,\nuse the following steps to create an archive bundle of this overlay and all of its dependent tests:\n\nGit is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below.\nGit can be downloaded from the [Git Web Site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\n\nWhen the **\"runner\"** host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps:\n\n```bash\nmkdir profiles\ncd profiles\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/microsoft-windows-10-stig-baseline.git\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] archive microsoft-windows-10-stig-baseline\n\n# Using `ssh` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter=cli json:<your_results_file.json>\n\n# Using `winrm` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --target winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>    \n```\n\nFor every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this profile baseline:\n\n```bash\ncd microsoft-windows-10-stig-baseline\ngit pull\ncd ..\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] archive microsoft-windows-10-stig-baseline --overwrite\n\n# Using `ssh` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter=cli json:<your_results_file.json>\n\n# Using `winrm` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --target winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>    \n```\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Different Run Options\n\n[Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Using Heimdall for Viewing Test Results\nThe JSON results output file can be loaded into **[Heimdall-Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)**\nor **[Heimdall-Server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)** for a user-interactive, graphical view of the profile scan results.\n\nHeimdall-Lite is a `browser only` viewer that allows you to easily view your results directly and locally rendered in your browser.\nHeimdall-Server is configured with a `data-services backend` allowing for data persistency to a database (PostgreSQL).\nFor more detail on feature capabilities see [Heimdall Features](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2?tab=readme-ov-file#features)\n\nHeimdall can **_export your results into a DISA Checklist (CKL) file_** for easily uploading into eMass using the `Heimdall Export` function.\n\nDepending on your environment restrictions, the [SAF CLI](https://saf-cli.mitre.org) can be used to run a local docker instance\nof Heimdall-Lite via the `saf view:heimdall` command.\n\nAdditionally both Heimdall applications can be deployed via docker, kubernetes, or the installation packages.\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Authors\n[Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)](https://www.disa.mil/)\n\n[STIG support by DISA Risk Management Team and Cyber Exchange](https://public.cyber.mil/)\n\n[MITRE Security Automation Framework Team](https://saf.mitre.org)\n\n### Developers\n* Aaron Lippold, Mitre - [aaronlippold](https://github.com/aaronlippold)\n* Jared Burns, VMware.Inc - [burnsjared0415](https://github.com/burnsjared0415)\n\n### Special Thanks\n* Shivani Karikar, DIFZ - [karikarshivani](https://github.com/karikarshivani)\n\n\n## NOTICE\n\n© 2018-2025 The MITRE Corporation.\n\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Since 1998, DISA has played a critical role enhancing the security posture of DoD's security systems by providing the STIGs. The STIGs contain technical guidance to \"lock down\" information systems/software that might otherwise be vulnerable to a malicious computer attack.\n\nThe requirements associated with the PostgreSQL STIG are derived from the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology) (NIST) [Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53) and related documents.\n\nWhile the PostgreSQL STIG was developed to provide technical guidance to \"lock down\" information systems used within the DoD, the guidance applies to all organizations that need to meet internal security as well as compliance standards.\n\nThe PostgreSQL STIG provides guidance on the configuration of PostgreSQL to address requirements associated with:\n\n- Authentication\n- Access Controls\n- Data encryption at rest and over the wire\n- Auditing\n- Logging\n- Administration\n- Protection against SQL Injection\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo run the PostgreSQL STIG Compliance Validator, there are specific requirements on both the database host as will as the STIG valudation host.\n\n#### Database Host\n\n- PostgreSQL 9.5+ cluster running on \\*nix host\n- Remote access to PostgreSQL Server\n- lsof\n- netstat\n\n#### STIG Validation Execution Host\n\n- Linux VM or Host\n- sudo access to install packages\n\n#### Required software on STIG Validation Execution Host\n\n- git\n- ssh\n- [InSpec](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-inspec/)\n\n### Setup Environment on STIG Validation Execution Host\n\n#### Install InSpec via your System Package Manager (recommended)\n\nThe InSpec community and chef provide packages for all major platforms. The installation package will bring all needed libraries and components needed by InSpec.\n\nThis is recommended for production and LTS environments.\n\nGoto <https://downloads.chef.io/inspec/stable> and copy download link\n\nFor example:\n\n- <https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/inspec/4.20.10/el/8/inspec-4.20.10-1.el7.x86_64.rpm>\n\n\n```sh\nsudo yum insall https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/inspec/4.20.10/el/8/inspec-4.20.10-1.el7.x86_64.rpm\n```\n\n#### Ensure InSpec Installed and is 4.x or higher\n\n```sh\ninspec --version\n```\n\n#### Install InSpec via GEM and RVM (alternative)\n\nIf you already have an existing Ruby environment configured on your system, or use RVM to manage your Ruby environments, you can always just install the InSpec gem and its dependencies using GEM.\n\n```sh\n$ curl -sSL https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg2 --import -\n$ curl -sSL https://rvm.io/pkuczynski.asc | gpg2 --import -\n$ curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable\n$ rvm install 2.4.0\n$ rvm use 2.4.0 --default\n\n$ source ${HOME}/.rvm/scripts/rvm\n```\n\n#### Install the needed gems\n\n```sh\ngem install inspec\n```\n\n#### Ensure InSpec Installed and is 4.x or higher\n\n```sh\ninspec --version\n```\n#### *Note* Windows and Linux InSpec Runner\n\nThere are current issues with how the profiles run when using a windows or linux runner. We have accounted for this in the profile with the `windows_runner` input - which we *default* to `false` assuming a Linux based InSpec runner.\n\nIf you are using a *Windows* based inspec installation, please set the `windows_runner` input to `true` either via your `inspec.yml` file or via the cli flag via, `--input windows_runner=true`\n### Setting & Reviewing the Core Profile Inputs\n\nThe `core` or `shared` inputs are set in the `inspec.yml` file in the profile. This stores the default values for the\nshared inputs that the profile uses to examine your system.\n\nThese inputs _should not be edited directly_!\n\nIf you need to override the default values for the core inputs to better match your system under evaluation, please:\n\n1. Review the inputs and their defaults in the `inspec.yml` and note the inputs you need to tailor for your installation.\n2. Create a `system` or `instance` specific `inputs.yml` - such as `inputs.mysystem.yml` and override the inputs with this file.\n3. When you run the profile, you can load your updated inputs using the `--attrs` flag on the `inspec exec` command (see below)\n\n### Sensitive Inputs (aka `passwords`, `system accounts` and `owners` in your PostgreSQL database )\n\nThe recommend way to store sensitive information is to use one of the environmental variables outlined below. For instance, you can set the password for the PostgreSQL user with the `PG_USER_PWD` environmental variable.\n\nAlternatively, you can set these variables in your `inputs.mysystem.yml` file, but again, this is not recommended for sensitive information like passwords.\n\n#### Set the following `environment variables` before you run the profile:\n\n- PG_OWNER\n- PG_OWNER_GRP\n- PG_OWNER_PWD\n- PG_DBA\n- PG_DBA_PWD\n- PG_USER\n- PG_USER_PWD\n- PG_HOST\n- PG_PORT\n- LOGIN_USER\n- LOGIN_HOST\n- PG_SYSLOG_OWNER\n\n### Examples for your `inputs.mysystem.yml`\n\n#### OS Group, User\n\n```yaml\npg_owner: \"postgres\"\npg_group: \"postgres\"\n# password set via `env_var`\n```\n\n#### DBA User\n\n```yaml\npg_dba: \"dba\"\n# password set via `env_var`\n```\n\n#### Normal DB User\n\n```yaml\npg_user: \"<username>\"\n# password set via `env_var`\n```\n\n#### DB Host and Port\n\n```yaml\npg_host: \"127.0.0.1\"\npg_port: \"5432\"\n```\n\n#### DB Name and Test table\n\n```yaml\npg_db: \"test_db\"\npg_table: \"test_table\"\n```\n\n#### Misc settings\n\n```yaml\nlogin_user: \"<user on remote DB server>\"\nlogin_host: \"<DB Host IP>\"\npg_version: \"9.5\"\npg_data_dir: \"/var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data\"\npg_conf_file: \"/var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data/postgresql.conf\"\npg_user_defined_conf: \"/var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data/stig-postgresql.conf\"\npg_hba_conf_file: \"/var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data/pg_hba.conf\"\npg_ident_conf_file: \"/var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data/pg_ident.conf\"\npg_shared_dirs:\n  [\n    \"/usr/pgsql-9.5\",\n    \"/usr/pgsql-9.5/bin\",\n    \"/usr/pgsql-9.5/lib\",\n    \"/usr/pgsql-9.5/share\",\n  ]\npg_conf_mode: \"0600\"\npg_ssl: \"on\"\npg_log_dest: \"syslog\"\npg_syslog_facility: [\"local0\"]\npg_syslog_owner: \"postgres\"\npgaudit_log_items: [\"ddl\", \"role\", \"read\", \"write\"]\npgaudit_log_line_items: [\"%m\", \"%u\", \"%c\"]\npg_superusers: [\"postgres\"]\npg_users: []\npg_replicas: [\"192.168.1.3/32\"]\npg_max_connections: \"100\"\npg_timezone: \"UTC\"\n```\n\n### Validating Your PostgreSQL Instance\n\n(See: <https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/>)\n\n# Running This Baseline Directly from Github\n\nAgainst a _**locally-hosted**_ instance (i.e., InSpec installed on the target hosting the postgresql database)\n```\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/pgstigcheck-inspec/archive/master.tar.gz --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\nAgainst a _**docker-containerized**_ instance (i.e., InSpec installed on the node hosting the container):\n```\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/pgstigcheck-inspec/archive/master.tar.gz -t docker://<instance_id> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n\n#### Execute a single Control in the Profile\n\n**Note**: replace the profile's directory name - e.g. - `pgstigcheck-inspec` with `.` if you are in the profile's root directory.\n\n```sh\ninspec exec pgstigcheck-inspec/controls/V-72845.rb --input-files=inputs.mysystem.yml -i <your ssh private key> -t ssh://<user>@<db host>:<port> --reporter cli json:myresults.json\n```\n\nor use the `--controls` flag\n\n```sh\ninspec exec pgstigcheck-inspec --controls=V-72845 V-72861 --input-file=inputs.mysystem.yml  -i <your ssh private key>  -t ssh://<user>@<db host>:<port> --reporter cli json:myresults.json\n```\n\n#### Execute a Single Control and save results as HTML\n\n```sh\ninspec exec pgstigcheck-inspec --controls=V-72845 --input-file=inputs.mysystem.yml -i <your ssh private key> --sudo --sudo-options=\"-u postgres\" -t ssh://<user>@<db host>:<port> --reporter cli html:myresults.html\n```\n\n#### Execute All Controls in the Profile\n\n```sh\ninspec exec pgstigcheck-inspec --input-file=inputs.yml -i <your ssh private key> --sudo --sudo-password=<sudo user password> --sudo-options=\"-u postgres\"  -t ssh://<user>@<db host>:<port> --reporter cli json:myresults.json\n```\n\n#### Execute all the Controls in the Profile and save results as HTML\n\n```sh\ninspec exec pgstigcheck-inspec --input-files=inputs.yml -i <your ssh private key> --sudo --sudo-password=<sudo user password> --sudo-options=\"-u postgres\" -t ssh://<user>@<db host>:<port> --reporter cli html:myresults.html\n```\n\n### Reviewing your results\n\nYou can review your results from above in many ways, as you saw your results came back in multiple outputs - on the cli and in either `json` or `html`.\n\nYou can learn more about the different [InSpec Reporters](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/reporters/) on the [inspec.io](http://www.inspec.io) site.\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n### Location, Location, Location\n\nThe `--reporters` flags **must _always_** be at the end of your `inspec exec` cli command as they can user either `=` or `spaces` and so they must be at the end of the command.\n\nIf you used the examples above, you should have a `myresults.json` or `myresults.html` which you can review.\n\n### HTML Reporter\n\nThe `myresults.html` in our examples - aka the InSpec HTML Reporter - is a working `html` file report but its output is very `technical` and is not recommended for **security review** or **accreditation discussions**.\n\n### Use MITRE Hiemdall or Heimdall-Lite\n\nUse the `JSON` InSpec Reporter output and the MITRE [Heimdall-Lite](http://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite) for the best possible view of the results.\n\nThe **recommended** review format for for **security review** or **accreditation discussions** is the `JSON` results format using the InSpec `JSON` reporter and the MITRE `heimdall-lite` viewer.\n\nYou can use heimdall-lite any-time anywhere from: <http://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/>. Heimdall-Lite is a Single Page Client Side JavaScript app that runs completely in your browser and was designed to help make reviewing, sorting and sharing your InSpec results easier.\n\nYou can also download the `.html` files via a simple `save as` from your browser should you need to use `heimdall-lite` in a disconnected setting.\n\n#### Heimdall vs Heimdall-Lite\n\n[Heimdall-Lite](http://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite) is a [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) powered client side only view of your data for teams and devs doing their security compliance work.\n\nIf you need a more ongoing compliance view of your InSpec results, get the full [MITRE Hiemdall](https://www.github.com/mitre/heimdall) application / server which provides enhanced capabilities - like storage, timelines and more - and is powered by Rails and CrunchyDB PostgreSQL.\n\nYou can find out more about the InSpec Tools and Open Source applications at <http://inspec.mitre.org>.\n\n## Sponsors\n\n[![Crunchy Data](/hugo/static/images/crunchy_logo.png)](https://www.crunchydata.com/)\n\n[Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com/) is pleased to sponsor pgstigcheck-inspec and many other [open-source projects](https://github.com/CrunchyData/) to help promote support the PostgreSQL community and software ecosystem.\n\n[![The MITRE Corporation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Mitre_Corporation_logo.svg)](https://www.mitre.org/)\n\n[The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org) is pleased to support our Sponsors and CrunchyData in the creation of the PostgreSQL 9.x STIG and the pgstigcheck-inspec validation profile.

These guidelines are the primary security standards\nused by the DoD agencies. In addition to defining security guidelines, the STIGs also stipulate\nhow security training should proceed and when security checks should occur. Organizations must\nstay compliant with these guidelines or they risk having their access to the DoD terminated.\n\nRequirements associated with the MS SQL Server 2014 Database STIG are derived from the\n[Security Requirements Guides](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_requirements_guide)\nand align to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST)\n[Special Publication (SP) 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#!/800-53)\nSecurity Controls, [DoD Control Correlation Identifier](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/) and related standards.\n\nThe MS SQL Server 2014 Database STIG profile checks were developed to provide technical implementation\nvalidation to the defined DoD requirements, the guidance can provide insight for any organizations wishing\nto enhance their security posture and can be tailored easily for use in your organization.\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Getting Started  \n### InSpec (CINC-auditor) setup\nFor maximum flexibility/accessibility `cinc-auditor`, the open-source packaged binary version of Chef InSpec should be used,\ncompiled by the CINC (CINC Is Not Chef) project in coordination with Chef using Chef's always-open-source InSpec source code.\nFor more information see [CINC Home](https://cinc.sh/)\n\nIt is intended and recommended that CINC-auditor and this profile executed from a __\"runner\"__ host\n(such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop)\nagainst the target. This can be any Unix/Linux/MacOS or Windows runner host, with access to the Internet.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> **For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the latest version of CINC-auditor and any other supporting language components.**\n\nTo install CINC-auditor on a UNIX/Linux/MacOS platform use the following command:\n```bash\ncurl -L https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P cinc-auditor\n```\n\nTo install CINC-auditor on a Windows platform (Powershell) use the following command:\n```powershell\n. { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.ps1 } | iex; install -project cinc-auditor\n```\n\nTo confirm successful install of cinc-auditor:\n```\ncinc-auditor -v\n```\n\nLatest versions and other installation options are available at [CINC Auditor](https://cinc.sh/start/auditor/) site.\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n### Intended Usage\n1. The latest `released` version of the profile is intended for use in A&A testing, as well as\n    providing formal results to Authorizing Officials and Identity and Access Management (IAM)s.\n    Please use the `released` versions of the profile in these types of workflows. \n\n2. The `main` branch is a development branch that will become the next release of the profile.\n    The `main` branch is intended for use in _developing and testing_ merge requests for the next\n    release of the profile, and _is not intended_ be used for formal and ongoing testing on systems.\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n### Tailoring to Your Environment\nThis profile uses InSpec Inputs providing flexibility during testing. Inputs allow for\ncustomize the behavior of Chef InSpec profiles.\n\nInSpec Inputs are defined in the `inspec.yml` file. The `inputs` configured in this\nfile are **profile definition and defaults for the profile** extracted from the profile\nguidances and contain metadata that describes the profile, and shouldn't be modified.\n\nInSpec provides several methods for customizing profiles behaviors at run-time that does not require\nmodifying the `inspec.yml` file itself (see [Using Customized Inputs](#using-customized-inputs)).\n\nThe following inputs are permitted to be configured in an inputs `.yml` file (often named inputs.yml)\nfor the profile to run correctly on a specific environment, while still complying with the security\nguidance document intent. This is important to prevent confusion when test results are passed downstream\nto different stakeholders under the *security guidance name used by this profile repository*\n\nFor changes beyond the inputs cited in this section, users can create an *organizationally-named overlay repository*.\nFor more information on developing overlays, reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre-saf-training.netlify.app/courses/beginner/10.html)\n\n#### Example of tailoring Inputs *While Still Complying* with the security guidance document for the profile:\n\n```yaml\n  # This file specifies the attributes for the configurable controls\n  # used by the MS SQL Server 2014 Database STIG profile.\n\n  # Disable controls that are known to consistently have long run times\n  disable_slow_controls: [true or false]\n\n  # A unique list of administrative users\n  admins_list: [admin1, admin2, admin3]\n\n  # List of configuration files for the specific system\n  logging_conf_files: [\n    <dir-path-1>/*.conf\n    <dir-path-2>/*.conf\n  ]\n  \n  ...\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>Inputs are variables that are referenced by control(s) in the profile that implement them.\n They are declared (defined) and given a default value in the `inspec.yml` file. \n\n#### Using Customized Inputs\nCustomized inputs may be used at the CLI by providing an input file or a flag at execution time.\n\n1. Using the `--input` flag\n  \n    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input disable_slow_controls=true`\n\n2. Using the `--input-file` flag.\n    \n    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input-file=<my_inputs_file.yml>`\n\n>[!TIP]\n> For additional information about `input` file examples reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre.github.io/saf-training/courses/beginner/06.html#input-file-example)\n\nChef InSpec Resources:\n- [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/).\n- [InSpec Inputs](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inputs/).\n- [inspec.yml](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inspec_yml/).\n\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n### Testing the Profile Controls\nThe Gemfile provided contains all the necessary ruby dependencies for checking the profile controls.\n#### Requirements\nAll action are conducted using `ruby` (gemstone/programming language). Currently `inspec` \ncommands have been tested with ruby version 3.1.2. A higher version of ruby is not guaranteed to\nprovide the expected results. Any modern distribution of Ruby comes with Bundler preinstalled by default.\n\nInstall ruby based on the OS being used, see [Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)\n\nAfter installing `ruby` install the necessary dependencies by invoking the bundler command\n(must be in the same directory where the Gemfile is located):\n```bash\nbundle install\n```\n\n#### Testing Commands\n\nLinting and validating controls:\n```bash\n  bundle exec rake [inspec or cinc-auditor]:check # validate the inspec profile\n  bundle exec rake lint                           # Run RuboCop\n  bundle exec rake lint:autocorrect               # Autocorrect RuboCop offenses (only when it's safe)\n  bundle exec rake lint:autocorrect_all           # Autocorrect RuboCop offenses (safe and unsafe)\n  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks              # pre-commit checks\n```\n\nEnsure the controls are ready to be committed into the repo:\n```bash\n  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks\n```\n\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Running the Profile\n### Directly from Github\nThis options is best used when network connectivity is available and policies permit\naccess to the hosting repository.\n\n```bash\n# Using `ssh` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec https://github.com/mitre/ms-sql-server-2014-database-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter=cli json:<your_results_file.json>\n\n# Using `winrm` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec https://github.com/mitre/ms-sql-server-2014-database-stig-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n### Using a local Archive copy\nIf your runner is not always expected to have direct access to the profile's hosted location,\nuse the following steps to create an archive bundle of this overlay and all of its dependent tests:\n\nGit is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below.\nGit can be downloaded from the [Git Web Site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\n\nWhen the **\"runner\"** host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps:\n\n```bash\nmkdir profiles\ncd profiles\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/ms-sql-server-2014-database-stig-baseline.git\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] archive ms-sql-server-2014-database-stig-baseline\n\n# Using `ssh` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter=cli json:<your_results_file.json>\n\n# Using `winrm` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --target winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>    \n```\n\nFor every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this profile baseline:\n\n```bash\ncd ms-sql-server-2014-database-stig-baseline\ngit pull\ncd ..\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] archive ms-sql-server-2014-database-stig-baseline --overwrite\n\n# Using `ssh` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter=cli json:<your_results_file.json>\n\n# Using `winrm` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --target winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>    \n```\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Different Run Options\n\n[Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Using Heimdall for Viewing Test Results\nThe JSON results output file can be loaded into **[Heimdall-Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)**\nor **[Heimdall-Server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)** for a user-interactive, graphical view of the profile scan results.\n\nHeimdall-Lite is a `browser only` viewer that allows you to easily view your results directly and locally rendered in your browser.\nHeimdall-Server is configured with a `data-services backend` allowing for data persistency to a database (PostgreSQL).\nFor more detail on feature capabilities see [Heimdall Features](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2?tab=readme-ov-file#features)\n\nHeimdall can **_export your results into a DISA Checklist (CKL) file_** for easily uploading into eMass using the `Heimdall Export` function.\n\nDepending on your environment restrictions, the [SAF CLI](https://saf-cli.mitre.org) can be used to run a local docker instance\nof Heimdall-Lite via the `saf view:heimdall` command.\n\nAdditionally both Heimdall applications can be deployed via docker, kubernetes, or the installation packages.\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Authors\n[Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)](https://www.disa.mil/)\n\n[STIG support by DISA Risk Management Team and Cyber Exchange](https://public.cyber.mil/)\n\n[MITRE Security Automation Framework Team](https://saf.mitre.org)\n\n## NOTICE\n\n© 2018-2025 The MITRE Corporation.\n\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Autocorrect RuboCop offenses (safe and unsafe)\n  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks              # Pre-commit checks\n```\n\nEnsure the controls are ready to be committed into the repo:\n```bash\n  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks\n```\n\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Running the Profile\n### Directly from Github\nThis option is best used when network connectivity is available and policies permit\naccess to the hosting repository.\n\n```bash\n# Using `ssh` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec https://github.com/mitre/ms-sql-server-2014-instance-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter=cli json:<your_results_file.json>\n\n# Using `winrm` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec https://github.com/mitre/ms-sql-server-2014-instance-stig-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n### Using a local Archive copy\nIf your runner is not always expected to have direct access to the profile's hosted location,\nuse the following steps to create an archive bundle of this overlay and all of its dependent tests:\n\nGit is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below.\nGit can be downloaded from the [Git Web Site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\n\nWhen the **\"runner\"** host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps:\n\n```bash\nmkdir profiles\ncd profiles\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/ms-sql-server-2014-instance-stig-baseline.git\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] archive ms-sql-server-2014-instance-stig-baseline\n\n# Using `ssh` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter=cli json:<your_results_file.json>\n\n# Using `winrm` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --target winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>    \n```\n\nFor every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this profile baseline:\n\n```bash\ncd ms-sql-server-2014-instance-stig-baseline\ngit pull\ncd ..\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] archive ms-sql-server-2014-instance-stig-baseline --overwrite\n\n# Using `ssh` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter=cli json:<your_results_file.json>\n\n# Using `winrm` transport\nbundle exec [inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <name of generated archive> --target winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>    \n```\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Different Run Options\n\n[Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Using Heimdall for Viewing Test Results\nThe JSON results output file can be loaded into **[Heimdall-Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)**\nor **[Heimdall-Server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)** for a user-interactive, graphical view of the profile scan results.\n\nHeimdall-Lite is a `browser only` viewer that allows you to easily view your results directly and locally rendered in your browser.\nHeimdall-Server is configured with a `data-services backend` allowing for data persistency to a database (PostgreSQL).\nFor more detail on feature capabilities see [Heimdall Features](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2?tab=readme-ov-file#features)\n\nHeimdall can **_export your results into a DISA Checklist (CKL) file_** for easily uploading into eMass using the `Heimdall Export` function.\n\nDepending on your environment restrictions, the [SAF CLI](https://saf-cli.mitre.org) can be used to run a local docker instance\nof Heimdall-Lite via the `saf view:heimdall` command.\n\nAdditionally both Heimdall applications can be deployed via docker, kubernetes, or the installation packages.\n\n[top](#table-of-contents)\n## Authors\n[Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)](https://www.disa.mil/)\n\n[STIG support by DISA Risk Management Team and Cyber Exchange](https://public.cyber.mil/)\n\n[MITRE Security Automation Framework Team](https://saf.mitre.org)\n\n## NOTICE\n\n© 2018-2025 The MITRE Corporation.\n\nApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

In the DoD, all IT systems must adhere to the rigorous Risk Management Framework (RMF) as defined in DoDI 8510.01. A critical component of RMF is the mandatory implementation of Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) and Security Requirements Guidelines (SRGs) as maintained by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Where a product specific STIG is not available, the relevant SRGs must be used instead.\n\n[DoDI 8510.01](http://acqnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DoD-Instruction-8510.01-Risk-Management-Framework-RMF-for-DoD-Information-Technology-IT-24-May-2016.pdf)\n\n>STIGs are product-specific and document applicable DoD policies and security\nrequirements, as well as best practices and configuration guidelines. STIGs are associated with\nsecurity controls through CCIs, which are decompositions of NIST SP 800-53 security controls\ninto single, actionable, measurable items. SRGs are developed by DISA to provide general\nsecurity compliance guidelines and serve as source guidance documents for STIGs. When a\nSTIG is not available for a product, an SRG may be used.\n\n[DoD Cybersecurity Discipline\nImplementation Plan](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Cyber/CyberDis-ImpPlan.pdf)\n\n>STIGs and SRGs provide\nconfiguration for technologies such as operating systems, browsers, antivirus, web services,\ndatabases, Active Directory, and domain name services. The combination of applicable STIGs\nand SRGs will result in a secure configuration to prevent issues such as insider threats, data\nexfiltration, or advanced persistent threats.\n\nIn order to better serve the needs of our DoD partners, and those who wish to meet the bar set by the DoD, VMware is providing three elements for community consumption and contribution.\n\n* STIG Readiness Guides\n  * SRG based content that is either the source material for an in process STIG, or that can be used in the absence of an official STIG.\n* Auditing Automation\n  * Automation to audit and report on the state of compliance for an associated set of SRG/STIG controls.\n* Remediation Automation\n  * Automation to remediate findings with a set of SRG/STIG controls using publicly accessible methods and APIs.\n\n## STIG Readiness Guides\nSTIG development is essentially an exercise where a specific product is filtered through all applicable SRGs to produce product-specific, NIST 800-53 backed hardening guidance. That content is then vetted, tested and approved by the DISA Risk Management Executive (RME) and posted on public.cyber.mil. VMware has a number of official STIGs published and we are working on many more. While we go through the official DISA vendor process, we want to make the SRG content available for public consumption and contributions while we wait for the official posting for products that are in process or are not scheduled to be submitted.\n\nFor more information on STIG Readiness Guides please read about our [STIG program](https://www.vmware.com/docs/vmw-stig-program-overview).\n\n__NOTE__: This project represents VMware's effort to document our compliance against the SRG requirements and nothing more. A published STIG is our eventual goal, in most cases, but this content should not be viewed to be \"as good as a STIG\". A DISA published STIG includes technical validation, review of requirement fulfillment, accuracy and style, risk acceptance and is digitally signed by the RME and posted on a .mil. This SRG content is intended to provided value to our partners while the STIGs are in process. Except for products that have published STIGs already, there is no explicit or implied DISA approval of the provided content.\n\n## Compliance Automation\nSTIG documents are written to be portable, offline hardening documentation where a sysadmin can go through, step by step, and STIG a system with no external dependencies. That said, many STIGs are either too complex or need to be applied to so many instances that manual steps are just not feasible. To augment the plain language STIG content, we are providing a number of ways to script or fully automate your VMware compliance activities.\n\n## Repo Structure\nAutomation provided here will be in the following structured format:  \n\n* Product\n  * Major Version\n    * README\n    * docs\n    * STIG Content Version\n\nFor example:\n* vsphere\n  * 8.0\n    * README\n    * docs\n    * v1r1-srg\n    * v1r1-stig\n\n*`srg` will denote STIG Readiness Guide content and `stig` will denote official STIG content*\n\n## Documentation\nDepending on the product, there may be a need to host DOD specific whitepapers, notes and addendums that have no other appropriate place.

It must be noted that the configuration settings specified should be evaluated in a local, representative test environment before implementation in a production environment, especially within large user populations.

Evaluating the risks and benefits to a system’s particular circumstances and requirements is the system owner's responsibility. The evaluated risks resulting from not applying specified configuration settings must be approved by the responsible Authorizing Official.\n\nFurthermore, VMware implies no warranty that the application of all specified configurations will make a system 100 percent secure. Security guidance is provided for the Department of Defense. While other agencies and organizations are free to use it, care must be given to ensure that all applicable security guidance is applied both at the device hardening level as well as the architectural level.

In the DoD, all IT systems must adhere to the rigorous Risk Management Framework (RMF) as defined in DoDI 8510.01. A critical component of RMF is the mandatory implementation of Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) and Security Requirements Guidelines (SRGs) as maintained by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Where a product specific STIG is not available, the relevant SRGs must be used instead.\n\n[DoDI 8510.01](http://acqnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DoD-Instruction-8510.01-Risk-Management-Framework-RMF-for-DoD-Information-Technology-IT-24-May-2016.pdf)\n\n>STIGs are product-specific and document applicable DoD policies and security\nrequirements, as well as best practices and configuration guidelines. STIGs are associated with\nsecurity controls through CCIs, which are decompositions of NIST SP 800-53 security controls\ninto single, actionable, measurable items. SRGs are developed by DISA to provide general\nsecurity compliance guidelines and serve as source guidance documents for STIGs. When a\nSTIG is not available for a product, an SRG may be used.\n\n[DoD Cybersecurity Discipline\nImplementation Plan](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Cyber/CyberDis-ImpPlan.pdf)\n\n>STIGs and SRGs provide\nconfiguration for technologies such as operating systems, browsers, antivirus, web services,\ndatabases, Active Directory, and domain name services.

That content is then vetted, tested and approved by the DISA Risk Management Executive (RME) and posted on public.cyber.mil. VMware has a number of official STIGs published and we are working on many more.

These guidelines are the primary security standards used by the DoD agencies. In addition to defining security guidelines, the STIGs also stipulate how security training should proceed and when security checks should occur. Organizations must stay compliant with these guidelines or they risk having their access to the DoD terminated.\n\nThe RHEL8 STIG (see public.cyber.mil/stigs/) offers a comprehensive compliance guide for the configuration and operation your RedHat Enterprise Linux 8.x system.\n\nThe requirements associated with the RHEL8 STIG are derived from the [Security Requirements Guides](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_requirements_guide) and align to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST) [Special Publication (SP) 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#!/800-53) Security Controls, [DoD Control Correlation Identifier](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/) and related standards.\n\nThe RHEL8.x STIG profile checks were developed to provide technical implementation validation to the defined DoD requirements, the guidance can provide insight for any organizations wishing to enhance their security posture and can be tailored easily for use in your organization.\n\n### Source Guidance\n\n- RedHat Enterprise Linux 8 Security Technical Implementation Guide V2R2\n\n### Current Profile Statistics\n\nThe profile is tested on every commit and every release against both `vanilla` and `hardened` ubi8 and ec2 images using [CI/CD pipelines](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline/actions). The `vanilla` images are unmodified base images sourced from Red Hat itself. The `hardened` images have had their settings configured for security according to STIG guidance, and are sourced from [Platform One's](https://p1.dso.mil/) [Iron Bank](https://login.dso.mil). Testing both vanilla and hardened configurations of both containerized and virtual machine implementations of RHEL8 is necessary to ensure the profile works in multiple environments.\n\n# Getting Started and Intended Usage\n\n1. It is intended and recommended that InSpec and the profile be run from a **\"runner\"** host, either from source or a local archieve - [Running the Profile](#running-the-profile) - (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target [ remotely over **ssh**].\n\n2. **For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.**\n\n3. The latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.\n\n4. Always use the latest version of the `released profile` (see below) on your system.\n\n## Intended Usage - `main` vs `releases`\n\n1. The latest 'released' version of the profile is intended for use in A&A testing, formal results to Authorizing Officials, Information Assurance Managers and other security stakeholders. Please use the tagged, released versions of the profile in these types of workflows.\n\n2. The `main` branch is a development branch that will become the next release of the profile. The `main` branch is intended for use in _developement and testing_ merge requests for the next release of the profile, and _is not intended_ be used for formal and ongoing testing on systems.\n\n## Environment Aware Testing\n\nThe RHEL8.x STIG profile is `container aware` and is able to determine when the profile is being executed inside or outside a container (ex. the Universal Base Image container images from Red Hat) and will only run the tests that are approporate for the enviroment it is testing in. The tests are tagged depending on their applicability to containers as opposed to full hosts.\n\nControls will be tagged as some combination of `host`, `container`, and `container-conditional`. Controls that apply to full host deployments (i.e. bare-metal servers or virtual machines) are marked `host`. Controls that apply to containers are marked `container`. Controls that only apply to containers depending on the packages and services included in the container are marked `container-conditional`.\n\nAll the profile's tests apply to the `host` but many of the controls are `Not Applicable` when running inside a container. (such as, for example, controls that test the system's kernel configuration). When running inside a container, the tests that only applicable to the host will be marked as `Not Applicable` automatically.\n\nInSpec also has a command-line flag to only run tests in a profile that match a given tag, if desired. See [Running Controls By Tag](#running-controls-by-tag).\n\n### Testing Containers\n\nNote that, because so many STIG requirements are not applicable to containers, it is often necessary to *also* asses the container host's STIG compliance. A container can only ever be as secure as the platform it runs on.\n\nFor example, many STIG controls concern the Linux kernel's settings. A container's configuration cannot affect the hosts's kernel, so these controls are marked as not applicable to containers. However, we still need to know if our container is running a secure kernel. As such, we need to asses *the container host's* kernel settings in addition to the container.\n\nIn practice, this usually means running an InSpec STIG compliance profile against *both* the container and the host, which are ultimately part of the same interconnected system.\n\n## Tailoring to Your Environment\n\n### Profile Inputs (see `inspec.yml` file)\n\nThis profile uses InSpec's [inputs](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inputs/) feature to make the tests more flexible. By default, the profile sets the inputs to baseline STIG-aligned values, but you are able to provide inputs at runtime either via the cli or via YAML files to help the profile work best in your deployment if necessary.\n\n#### **_Do not change the inputs in the `inspec.yml` file_**\n\nInputs are defined, and given a default value, in the `inspec.yml` file at the root of the profile directory. The inputs configured in the `inspec.yml` file are **profile definitions and defaults**, and it is not intended for the user to modify them in that file directly. To tailor the profile inputs to match your deployment or organizationally defined values, **_you should instead override the inputs_** as described below.\n\nIt is recommended to review `inspec.yml`'s `inputs` section to get the list of all inputs that can be configured and see if any of them need to be overridden to more accurately scan your system.\n\n#### Update Profile Inputs from the CLI or Local File\n\nInSpec provides two ways to adjust the profiles inputs at run-time that do not require modifiying `inspec.yml` itself:\n\n1. Via the cli with the `--input` flag\n2. Pass them in a YAML file with the `--input-file` flag.\n\nMore information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Inputs Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/inputs/).\n\n#### Sample Input File\n\nThe following YAML file is formatted as an InSpec input file. \n\nNote that any of the inputs that are not explicitly overridden by this file will be set to their default values (as given in `inspec.yml`) when the profile is run.\n\n```yaml\ndisable_slow_controls: true\nkernel_config_files:\n  - \"/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf\"\n  - \"/run/sysctl.d/*.conf\"\n  - \"/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf\"\n  - \"/etc/sysctl.conf\"\nuser_accounts:\n  - \"jdoe\"\nipv4_enabled: false\nbluetooth_installed: false\nknown_system_accounts:\n  - adm\n  - bin\n  - chrony\n  - daemon\n  - dbus\n  - halt\n  - lp\n  - mail\n  - nobody\n  - ntp\n  - operator\n  - polkitd\n  - postfix\n  - root\n  - shutdown\n  - sshd\n  - sssd\n  - sync\n  - systemd-bus-proxy\n  - systemd-network\nprivate_key_files:\n  - \"/home/jdoe/.ssh/id_rsa.pem\"\nsystem_inactivity_timeout:\n  - 1500\ngui_required: true\n```\n\n# Running the Profile\n\nInSpec profiles can be executed against a local system, or a remote system using a transport. Airgapped environments can use an archived profile for local execution.\n\n## Running the Profile in an Internet-Connected Environment\n\nInSpec can execute a test profile directly from a source code repository -- for example, GitHub. It is recommended to run the profile using the source GitHub repository as the profile source where possible. This ensures that you are always running the profile version with the latest patch updates.\n\nIt is also recommended to \"pin\" the version of the profile you are running from GitHub by specifying a tagged minor release (ex. \"v1.13\" -- see the \"Organization of the Repository\" section). This way, you will always know exactly which version and release of the STIG you are using to validate your system.\n\nAgainst a remote target using ssh with escalated privileges (i.e., InSpec installed on a separate runner host)\n```bash\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline/archive/v1.13.tar.gz -t ssh://TARGET_USERNAME:TARGET_PASSWORD@TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT --sudo --sudo-password=<SUDO_PASSWORD_IF_REQUIRED> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter json:<path_to_your_desired_output_file.json>\n```\nAgainst a remote target using a pem key with escalated privileges (i.e., InSpec installed on a separate runner host)\n```bash\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline/archive/v1.13.tar.gz -t ssh://TARGET_USERNAME@TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT --sudo -i <path_to_your_pem_key> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter json:<path_to_your_desired_output_file.json> \n```\nAgainst a local running Red Hat Docker container (i.e., InSpec installed on the container host):\n```bash\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline/archive/v1.13.tar.gz -t docker://<name_of_the_container> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter json:<path_to_your_desired_output_file.json> \n```\nAgainst a local Red Hat host with escalated privileges (i.e., InSpec installed directly on the target)\n```bash\nsudo inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline/archive/v1.13.tar.gz --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter json:<path_to_your_desired_output_file.json> \n```\n## Running the Profile in an Airgapped (disconnected) Environment\n\nIf your runner will not have direct access to the profile's hosted location, you can use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this overlay and all of its dependent tests:\n\n(A local Git installation is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site. Airgapped systems will need to use alternate sources for downloading Git.)\n\nWhen the **\"runner\"** host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps:\n\n```\nmkdir profiles\ncd profiles\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline.git\ninspec archive redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline\n<sneakerNet your archive>\ninspec exec <name of generated archive> --input-file=<your_inputs_file.yml> -t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo --reporter json:<your_results_file.json>\n```\n\nFor every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this overlay and dependent profiles:\n\n1. Delete and recreate your archive as shown above, or:\n2. Update your archive with the following steps\n\n```\ncd redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline\ngit pull\ncd ..\ninspec archive redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline\n```\n\n## Different Run Options\n\n[Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)\n\n## Attestations\n\nNot all controls in the STIG can be checked automatically by InSpec. Some controls are 'manual' -- for example, require the tester to confirm the existence of a written policy, or a control may state that a package is allowable only if the system ISSO confirms in an interview that it is necessary for that particular system. In these cases, InSpec will mark the test as `skipped` (as opposed to `passed` or `failed`) in the output. Note that this is a separate concept to a test that is `Not Applicable` -- unlike an N/A test, a `skipped` test still needs the tester to go back and determine manually if it passes or fails.\n\nA tester can use the [SAF CLI's Attestation function](https://saf-cli.mitre.org/#attest) to record a manual assesment of a control as a file that can then be inserted back into an automated workflow as data. Attestations are valid for a specified timespan (1 day, 1 month, 1 year etc.), and can therefore be automatically \"appended\" to automated test results generated by pipelines or conducting a scan to produce a single report on the state of a system. The Heimdall application (see next section) can display automated test results that have been enhanced by attestation files, and note which controls were manual attestations and how long those attestations are valid.\n\n# Using Heimdall for Viewing Test Results and Exporting for Checklist and eMASS\n\nThe JSON results output file can be loaded into **[Heimdall](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)** for a user-interactive, graphical view of the profile scan results. Heimdall-Lite is a browser only viewer that allows you to easily view your results directly and locally rendered in your browser.\n\nIt can also **_export your results into a DISA Checklist (CKL) file_** using the `Heimdall Export` function, for easily upload into eMASS.\n\nDepending on your enviroment, you can also use the [SAF CLI](https://saf-cli.mitre.org) pipeline utility tool to run a local Docker instance of heimdall-lite via the `saf view:heimdall` command.\n\nThe JSON results file may also be loaded into a **[full Heimdall Server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)**, allowing for additional functionality such as storing, aggregating and comparing multiple profile runs.\n\nYou can deploy your own instances of Heimdall Lite or Heimdall Server easily via Docker, onto Kurbernetes, or using the installation packages.\n\n## Organization of the Repository\n\n### `main` and `development` branch\n\nThe `main` branch contains the most recent code for the profile. It may include bugs and is typically aligned with the latest patch release for the profile. ***The main branch is not meant for real scanning or production systems***. \n\nThis branch is primarily used for development and testing workflows for the various testing targets.\n\nFor production validation, use the latest tagged patch release, such as `v1.13.1`.\n\n### `#v{x}r{y}.{z}` branches\n\nThe `v{x}r{y}.{z}` branches represent the changes between releases of the benchmark. They align with the STIG releases for the Benchmark found at the DISA STIG Document Library. `{x}` aligns to the Version of the STIG Benchmark, `{y}` aligns to the Release of the Benchmark, and `{z}` aligns to the 'Release' of the tagged release of the profile as we fix or improve the tests.\n\n### Releases\n\nReleases use Semantic Versioning (SemVer), aligning with the STIG Benchmark versioning system of Major Version and Release. The SemVer patch number is used for updates, bug fixes, and code changes between STIG Benchmark Releases for the given product. STIG Benchmarks use a Version and Release tagging pattern `v{x}r{y}.{z}` - like V1R13 - and we mirror that pattern in our SemVer releases - and a patch release for any updates or fixes.\n\n### Tags\n\nThis profile does not use a specific 'current' or 'latest' tag. The current/latest tag for the profile and repository will always be the latest major tag of the benchmark. For example, if `version 1, release 13` is the latest Benchmark release from the STIG author, then the tag `v1.13` will point to the `v1.13.3` release of the code.\n\n#### Major and Minor Version Tags\n\nMajor tags point to the latest version of the STIG that they test, and minor tags point to the latest version and release of a STIG. The patch tag indicates the patch number of the InSpec profile itself and is the only tag in the semver that does not directly correspond to the STIG's schema.\n\nFor example, `v1.3` and `v1.3.0` represent the first release of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 STIG V1R3 Benchmark. The `v1.13.{z}` tag(s) represents the V1R13 Benchmark releases as the profile authors find bugs, fixes, or general improvements to the testing profile. This tag will point to its `v{x}r{y}.{z}` counterpart.\n\n### Patch Releases\n\nThe latest patch release always points to the release for the profile.\n\nFor example, after releasing `v1.13.0`, we point `v1.13` to that patch release: `v1.13.0`. When an issue is found, we will fix, tag, and release `v1.13.1`. We will then 'move' the `v1.13` tag so that it points to tag `v1.13.1`. This way, your pipelines can choose if they want to pin on a specific release of the InSpec profile or always run 'current' for a particular release of the STIG.\n\n## Updates, Releases & Submitting PRs to the Profile\n\nThis profile is updated and managed using our standard MITRE SAF InSpec Profile Development and Update process. You can learn more about this and how to help us keep the profile up to date from release to release of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 STIG Benchmark at [SAF Profile Maintenance](https://mitre.github.io/saf-training-current/courses/profile-dev-test) Process.\n\nFor example, `v1.13.2` would be the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 STIG Version 1 Release 13 with two 'patch' releases from the first `v1.13.0` release.\n### Create an InSpec Release\nFor information on how to create an InSpec Profile release referecnes instruction listed in the [SAF CLI Developers Corner](https://github.com/mitre/saf/wiki/How-to-Create-an-InSpec-Profile-Release)\n### Submitting Bugs\n\nIf you find an issue or a test that isn't operating as you expect, please submit an issue on the repository.\n\nIf possible, after you remove any identifying information about who and where your target is deployed, please provide a way we can 'reproduce' the error, any specific configuration examples on the target that cause the issue, or examples of settings, strings or other configuration settings we might need to reproduce the issue.\n\n# Authors\n\nDefense Information Systems Agency (DISA) https://www.disa.mil/\n\nSTIG support by DISA Risk Management Team and Cyber Exchange https://public.cyber.mil/\n\nMITRE Security Automation Framework Team https://saf.mitre.org\n"]

In the DoD, all IT systems must adhere to the rigorous Risk Management Framework (RMF) as defined in DoDI 8510.01. A critical component of RMF is the mandatory implementation of Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) and Security Requirements Guidelines (SRGs) as maintained by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Where a product specific STIG is not available, the relevant SRGs must be used instead.\n\n[DoDI 8510.01](http://acqnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DoD-Instruction-8510.01-Risk-Management-Framework-RMF-for-DoD-Information-Technology-IT-24-May-2016.pdf)\n\n>STIGs are product-specific and document applicable DoD policies and security\nrequirements, as well as best practices and configuration guidelines. STIGs are associated with\nsecurity controls through CCIs, which are decompositions of NIST SP 800-53 security controls\ninto single, actionable, measurable items. SRGs are developed by DISA to provide general\nsecurity compliance guidelines and serve as source guidance documents for STIGs. When a\nSTIG is not available for a product, an SRG may be used.\n\n[DoD Cybersecurity Discipline\nImplementation Plan](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Cyber/CyberDis-ImpPlan.pdf)\n\n>STIGs and SRGs provide\nconfiguration for technologies such as operating systems, browsers, antivirus, web services,\ndatabases, Active Directory, and domain name services. The combination of applicable STIGs\nand SRGs will result in a secure configuration to prevent issues such as insider threats, data\nexfiltration, or advanced persistent threats.\n\nIn order to better serve the needs of our DoD partners, and those who wish to meet the bar set by the DoD, VMware is providing three elements for community consumption and contribution.\n\n* STIG Readiness Guides\n  * SRG based content that is either the source material for an in process STIG, or that can be used in the absence of an official STIG.\n* Auditing Automation\n  * Automation to audit and report on the state of compliance for an associated set of SRG/STIG controls.\n* Remediation Automation\n  * Automation to remediate findings with a set of SRG/STIG controls using publicly accessible methods and APIs.\n\n## STIG Readiness Guides\nSTIG development is essentially an exercise where a specific product is filtered through all applicable SRGs to produce product-specific, NIST 800-53 backed hardening guidance. That content is then vetted, tested and approved by the DISA Risk Management Executive (RME) and posted on public.cyber.mil. VMware has a number of official STIGs published and we are working on many more. While we go through the official DISA vendor process, we want to make the SRG content available for public consumption and contributions while we wait for the official posting for products that are in process or are not scheduled to be submitted.\n\nFor more information on STIG Readiness Guides please read about our [STIG program](https://www.vmware.com/docs/vmw-stig-program-overview).\n\n__NOTE__: This project represents VMware's effort to document our compliance against the SRG requirements and nothing more. A published STIG is our eventual goal, in most cases, but this content should not be viewed to be \"as good as a STIG\". A DISA published STIG includes technical validation, review of requirement fulfillment, accuracy and style, risk acceptance and is digitally signed by the RME and posted on a .mil. This SRG content is intended to provided value to our partners while the STIGs are in process. Except for products that have published STIGs already, there is no explicit or implied DISA approval of the provided content.\n\n## Compliance Automation\nSTIG documents are written to be portable, offline hardening documentation where a sysadmin can go through, step by step, and STIG a system with no external dependencies. That said, many STIGs are either too complex or need to be applied to so many instances that manual steps are just not feasible. To augment the plain language STIG content, we are providing a number of ways to script or fully automate your VMware compliance activities.\n\n## Repo Structure\nAutomation provided here will be in the following structured format:  \n\n* Product\n  * Major Version\n    * README\n    * docs\n    * STIG Content Version\n\nFor example:\n* vsphere\n  * 8.0\n    * README\n    * docs\n    * v1r1-srg\n    * v1r1-stig\n\n*`srg` will denote STIG Readiness Guide content and `stig` will denote official STIG content*\n\n## Documentation\nDepending on the product, there may be a need to host DOD specific whitepapers, notes and addendums that have no other appropriate place. These items will be provided under the docs path where applicable.\n\n## Support\nMore information on support for STIGs and STIG Readiness Guides is available in the [Support](SUPPORT.md) document.\n\n## Archives\nThe `master` branch in this repo will contain only content for currently supported products. Access to older revisions of guidance and automation for products that are no longer supported and End of Life(EoL) will be available in the `archived_content` branch.  \n\n## Contributing\nThe dod-compliance-and-automation project team welcomes contributions from the community. If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our contributor license agreement (CLA), our bot will update the issue when you open a Pull Request. For any questions about the CLA process, please refer to our [FAQ](https://cla.vmware.com/faq).\n\n* __STIG Readiness Guides Content__ - VMware owns the state of the SRG/STIG controls provided here, including their applicability and how the requirements are addressed. That said, we are open to ideas for further hardening, additional methods, refinements, expansion, etc.\n\n* __Automation Content__ - VMware provides the automation content in a beta complete state. Once it is used by the broad github audience, we expect the need for refinements and we highly encourage feedback and direct contributions.\n\n## Disclaimer\nVMware accepts no liability for the consequences of applying specific configuration settings made on the basis of the SRGs/STIGs. It must be noted that the configuration settings specified should be evaluated in a local, representative test environment before implementation in a production environment, especially within large user populations. The extensive variety of environments makes it impossible to test these configuration settings for all potential software configurations.\n\nFor some production environments, failure to test before implementation may lead to a loss of required functionality. Evaluating the risks and benefits to a system’s particular circumstances and requirements is the system owner's responsibility. The evaluated risks resulting from not applying specified configuration settings must be approved by the responsible Authorizing Official.\n\nFurthermore, VMware implies no warranty that the application of all specified configurations will make a system 100 percent secure. Security guidance is provided for the Department of Defense. While other agencies and organizations are free to use it, care must be given to ensure that all applicable security guidance is applied both at the device hardening level as well as the architectural level. Some of the controls may not be configurable in environments outside the DoDIN.\n\n## License\nThe dod-compliance-and-automation project is available under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE).\n"]

Profiles can also be executed directly on the host where InSpec is installed (see https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/). \n\n## Running This Overlay Directly from Github against a hosted (non AWS RDS) instance of MySQL 8: \n\nAgainst a remote target using ssh (i.e., inspec installed on a separate runner host)\n```bash\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz -t ssh://<target_username>:<target_password>@<target_ip>:<target_port> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> \n```\n\nAgainst a remote target using a pem key (i.e., inspec installed on a separate runner host)\n```bash\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz -t ssh://<target_username>@<target_ip>:<target_port> -i <PEM_KEY> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>  \n```\n\nAgainst a _**locally-hosted**_ instance (i.e., inspec installed on the target hosting the database)\n\n```bash\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n\nAgainst a _**docker-containerized**_ instance (i.e., inspec installed on the node hosting the container):\n```\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz -t docker://<instance_id> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n## Running This Overlay Directly from Github against an AWS RDS instance of MySQL 8: \n\n```bash\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> \n```\n## Running This Overlay from a local Archive copy \n\nIf your runner is not always expected to have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this overlay and all of its dependent tests:\n\n(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.)\n\nWhen the __\"runner\"__ host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps: \n\n```\nmkdir profiles\ncd profiles\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline.git\ninspec archive oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline\ninspec exec <name of generated archive> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n\nFor every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this overlay and dependent profiles:\n\n```\ncd oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline\ngit pull\ncd ..\ninspec archive oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline --overwrite\ninspec exec <name of generated archive> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n\n## Using Heimdall for Viewing the JSON Results\n\nThe JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. \n\nThe JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.\n\n## Authors\n* Eugene Aronne - [ejaronne](https://github.com/ejaronne)\n\n## Special Thanks\n* Aaron Lippold - [aaronlippold](https://github.com/aaronlippold)\n* Shivani Karikar - [karikarshivani](https://github.com/karikarshivani)\n\n## Contributing and Getting Help\nTo report a bug or feature request, please open an [issue](https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-8-stig-baseline/issues/new).\n\n\n\n\n## Generalized execution cases:\n\n#### Execute a single control in the profile \n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile> --input-file=<name of your inputs file>.yml --controls=SV-235096 -t <target>\n```\n#### Execute a single control in the profile and save results as JSON\n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile> --input-file=<name of your inputs file>.yml --controls=<control id> -t <target> --reporter cli json:results.json\n```\n#### Execute all controls in the profile \n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile> --input-file=<name of your inputs file>.yml -t <target>\n```\n#### Execute all controls in the profile and save results as JSON\n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile> --input-file=<name of your inputs file>.yml -t <target> --reporter cli json:results.json\n```\n#### Execute the profile directly on the MySQL database host\n```bash\ninspec exec <path to profile> --input-file=<name of your inputs file>.yml --reporter cli json:results.json\n```\n"]

These guidelines are the primary security standards\r\nused by the DoD agencies. In addition to defining security guidelines, the STIGs also stipulate\r\nhow security training should proceed and when security checks should occur. Organizations must\r\nstay compliant with these guidelines or they risk having their access to the DoD terminated.\r\n\r\nRequirements associated with the Crunchy Data PostgreSQL STIG are derived from the\r\n[Security Requirements Guides](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_requirements_guide)\r\nand align to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST)\r\n[Special Publication (SP) 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#!/800-53)\r\nSecurity Controls, [DoD Control Correlation Identifier](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/) and related standards.\r\n\r\nThe Crunchy Data PostgreSQL STIG profile checks were developed to provide technical implementation\r\nvalidation to the defined DoD requirements, the guidance can provide insight for any organizations wishing\r\nto enhance their security posture and can be tailored easily for use in your organization.\r\n\r\n[top](#table-of-contents)\r\n## Getting Started  \r\n### InSpec (CINC-auditor) setup\r\nFor maximum flexibility/accessibility `cinc-auditor`, the open-source packaged binary version of Chef InSpec should be used,\r\ncompiled by the CINC (CINC Is Not Chef) project in coordination with Chef using Chef's always-open-source InSpec source code.\r\nFor more information see [CINC Home](https://cinc.sh/)\r\n\r\nIt is intended and recommended that CINC-auditor and this profile executed from a __\"runner\"__ host\r\n(such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop)\r\nagainst the target. This can be any Unix/Linux/MacOS or Windows runner host, with access to the Internet.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> **For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the latest version of CINC-auditor and any other supporting language components.**\r\n\r\nTo install CINC-auditor on a UNIX/Linux/MacOS platform use the following command:\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -L https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P cinc-auditor\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install CINC-auditor on a Windows platform (Powershell) use the following command:\r\n```powershell\r\n. { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.ps1 } | iex; install -project cinc-auditor\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo confirm successful install of cinc-auditor:\r\n```\r\ncinc-auditor -v\r\n```\r\n\r\nLatest versions and other installation options are available at [CINC Auditor](https://cinc.sh/start/auditor/) site.\r\n\r\n[top](#table-of-contents)\r\n### Intended Usage\r\n1. The latest `released` version of the profile is intended for use in A&A testing, as well as\r\n    providing formal results to Authorizing Officials and Identity and Access Management (IAM)s.\r\n    Please use the `released` versions of the profile in these types of workflows. \r\n\r\n2. The `main` branch is a development branch that will become the next release of the profile.\r\n    The `main` branch is intended for use in _developing and testing_ merge requests for the next\r\n    release of the profile, and _is not intended_ be used for formal and ongoing testing on systems.\r\n\r\n[top](#table-of-contents)\r\n### Tailoring to Your Environment\r\nThis profile uses InSpec Inputs to provide flexibility during testing. Inputs allow for\r\ncustomizing the behavior of Chef InSpec profiles.\r\n\r\nInSpec Inputs are defined in the `inspec.yml` file. The `inputs` configured in this\r\nfile are **profile definitions and defaults for the profile** extracted from the profile\r\nguidances and contain metadata that describe the profile, and shouldn't be modified.\r\n\r\nInSpec provides several methods for customizing profile behaviors at run-time that does not require\r\nmodifying the `inspec.yml` file itself (see [Using Customized Inputs](#using-customized-inputs)).\r\n\r\nThe following inputs are permitted to be configured in an inputs `.yml` file (often named inputs.yml)\r\nfor the profile to run correctly on a specific environment, while still complying with the security\r\nguidance document intent. This is important to prevent confusion when test results are passed downstream\r\nto different stakeholders under the *security guidance name used by this profile repository*\r\n\r\nFor changes beyond the inputs cited in this section, users can create an *organizationally-named overlay repository*.\r\nFor more information on developing overlays, reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre-saf-training.netlify.app/courses/beginner/10.html)\r\n\r\n#### Example Inputs You Can Use\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# Changes checks depending on if using a Windows or Linux-based

[!NOTE]\r\n>Inputs are variables that are referenced by control(s) in the profile that implement them.\r\n They are declared (defined) and given a default value in the `inspec.yml` file. \r\n\r\n#### Using Customized Inputs\r\nCustomized inputs may be used at the CLI by providing an input file or a flag at execution time.\r\n\r\n1. Using the `--input` flag\r\n  \r\n    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input disable_slow_controls=true`\r\n\r\n2. Using the `--input-file` flag.\r\n    \r\n    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input-file=<my_inputs_file.yml>`\r\n\r\n>[!TIP]\r\n> For additional information about `input` file examples reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre.github.io/saf-training/courses/beginner/06.html#input-file-example)\r\n\r\nChef InSpec Resources:\r\n- [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/).\r\n- [InSpec Inputs](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inputs/).\r\n- [inspec.yml](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inspec_yml/).\r\n\r\n\r\n[top](#table-of-contents)\r\n### Testing the Profile Controls\r\nThe Gemfile provided contains all the necessary ruby dependencies for checking the profile controls.\r\n#### Requirements\r\nAll action are conducted using `ruby` (gemstone/programming language). Currently `inspec` \r\ncommands have been tested with ruby version 3.1.2. A higher version of ruby is not guaranteed to\r\nprovide the expected results. Any modern distribution of Ruby comes with Bundler preinstalled by default.\r\n\r\nInstall ruby based on the OS being used, see [Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)\r\n\r\nAfter installing `ruby` install the necessary dependencies by invoking the bundler command\r\n(must be in the same directory where the Gemfile is located):\r\n```bash\r\nbundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\n[top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n#### Testing against a Local Postgres Container\r\nAs a developer or someone wanting to test the profile without an existing database target, there are files available to start up a docker container with a test PostgreSQL 2016 database instance.

This can be any Unix/Linux/MacOS or Windows runner host, with access to the Internet.\n\n__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec__ \n\nLatest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.\n\n### PSQL client setup\n\nTo run the PostgreSQL profile against an AWS RDS Instance, InSpec expects the psql client to be readily available on the same runner system it is installed on.\n \nFor example, to install the psql client on a Linux runner host:\n```\nsudo yum install postgresql\n```\nTo confirm successful install of psql:\n```\nwhich psql\n```\n> sample output:  _/usr/bin/psql_\n```\npsql –-version\n```\t\t\n> sample output:  *psql (PostgreSQL) 12.9*\n\nTest psql connectivity to your instance from your runner host:\n```\npsql -d postgresql://<master user>:<password>@<endpoint>.amazonaws.com/postgres\n```\t\t\n> *sample output:*\n> \n>  *psql (12.9)*\n>  \n>  *SSL connection (cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256)*\n>  \n>  *Type \"help\" for help.*\n>  \n>  *postgres-> \\conninfo*\n>  \n>  *You are connected to database \"postgres\" as user \"postgres\" on host \"(endpoint).us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\" at port \"5432\".*\n>  \n>  *postgres=> \\q*\n>  \n>  *$*\n\nFor installation of psql client on other operating systems for your runner host, visit https://www.postgresql.org/\n  \n## Inputs: Tailoring your scan to Your Environment\nThe following inputs must be configured in an inputs \".yml\" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).\n#### *Note* Windows and Linux InSpec Runner\n\nThere are current issues with how the profiles run when using a windows or linux runner. We have accounted for this in the profile with the `windows_runner` input - which we *default* to `false` assuming a Linux based InSpec runner.\n\nIf you are using a *Windows* based inspec installation, please set the `windows_runner` input to `true` either via your `inspec.yml` file or via the cli flag via, `--input windows_runner=true`\n\n### Example Inputs You Can Use\n\n```yaml\n# Windows or Linux Runner (default value = false)\nwindows_runner: false\n\n# Description: 'Postgres database admin user (e.g., 'postgres').'\npg_dba: '<master user, e.g., postgres>'\n\n# Description: 'Postgres database admin password (e.g., 'tesT$4329uyskdj!kjh').'\npg_dba_password: '<password>'\n\n# Description: 'Postgres database hostname'\npg_host: '<endpoint>.amazonaws.com'\n\n# Description: 'Postgres database name (e.g., 'postgres')'\npg_db: '<database name>'\n\n# Description: 'Postgres database port'\npg_port: '5432'\n\n# Description: 'Postgres users e.g., [\"pg_signal_backend\", \"postgres\", \"rds_iam\", \"rds_pgaudit\", \"rds_replication\", \"rds_superuser\", \"rdsadmin\", \"rdsrepladmin\"]'\npg_users: [\"pg_signal_backend\", \"postgres\", \"rds_iam\", \"rds_pgaudit\", \"rds_replication\", \"rds_superuser\", \"rdsadmin\", \"rdsrepladmin\"]\n\n# Description: 'list of approved database extensions'\napproved_ext: [\"pgaudit\"]\n\n# Description: 'uses this list of approved postgres-related packages (e.g., postgresql-server.x86_64, postgresql-odbc.x86_64)'\napproved_packages: []\n\n# Description: 'Postgres super users (e.g., ['postgres']).'\npg_superusers: []\n\n# Description: 'Database version' (e.g., 12.9)\npg_version: ''\n\n# Description: 'Postgres ssl setting (e.g., 'on').'\npg_ssl: ''\n\n# Description: 'Postgres audit log items (e.g., ['ddl','role','read','write']).'\npgaudit_log_items: []\n\n# Description: 'Postgres audit log line items (e.g. ['%m','%u','%c']).'\npgaudit_log_line_items: []\n\n# Description: 'Postgres replicas (e.g. ['192.168.1.3/32']).'\npg_replicas: []\n\n# Description: 'Postgres max number of connections allowed (e.g., 100).'\npg_max_connections: 100\n\n# Description: 'Postgres timezone (e.g., 'UTC').'\npg_timezone: 'UTC'\n```\n\n# Running This Baseline Directly from Github\n\n```\n# How to run\ninspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-rds-crunchy-data-postgresql-stig-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n\n### Different Run Options\n\n  [Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)\n\n## Running This Baseline from a local Archive copy \n\nIf your runner is not always expected to have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this baseline and all of its dependent tests:\n\n(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.)\n\nWhen the __\"runner\"__ host uses this profile baseline for the first time, follow these steps: \n\n```\nmkdir profiles\ncd profiles\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/aws-rds-crunchy-data-postgresql-stig-baseline\ninspec archive aws-rds-crunchy-data-postgresql-stig-baseline\ninspec exec <name of generated archive> -t ssh:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\nFor every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this baseline:\n\n```\ncd aws-rds-crunchy-data-postgresql-stig-baseline\ngit pull\ncd ..\ninspec archive aws-rds-crunchy-data-postgresql-stig-baseline --overwrite\ninspec exec <name of generated archive> -t ssh:// --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>\n```\n\n## Viewing the JSON Results\n\nThe JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. \n\nThe JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.\n\n## Authors\n* Alicia Sturtevant - [asturtevant](https://github.com/asturtevant)\n\n## Special Thanks \n* Mohamed El-Sharkawi - [HackerShark](https://github.com/HackerShark)\n* Shivani Karikar - [karikarshivani](https://github.com/karikarshivani)\n\n## Contributing and Getting Help\nTo report a bug or feature request, please open an [issue](https://github.com/mitre/aws-rds-crunchy-data-postgresql-stig-baseline/issues/new).\n"]

In the DoD, all IT systems must adhere to the rigorous Risk Management Framework (RMF) as defined in DoDI 8510.01. A critical component of RMF is the mandatory implementation of Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) and Security Requirements Guidelines (SRGs) as maintained by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Where a product specific STIG is not available, the relevant SRGs must be used instead.\n\n[DoDI 8510.01](http://acqnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DoD-Instruction-8510.01-Risk-Management-Framework-RMF-for-DoD-Information-Technology-IT-24-May-2016.pdf)\n\n>STIGs are product-specific and document applicable DoD policies and security\nrequirements, as well as best practices and configuration guidelines. STIGs are associated with\nsecurity controls through CCIs, which are decompositions of NIST SP 800-53 security controls\ninto single, actionable, measurable items. SRGs are developed by DISA to provide general\nsecurity compliance guidelines and serve as source guidance documents for STIGs. When a\nSTIG is not available for a product, an SRG may be used.\n\n[DoD Cybersecurity Discipline\nImplementation Plan](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Cyber/CyberDis-ImpPlan.pdf)\n\n>STIGs and SRGs provide\nconfiguration for technologies such as operating systems, browsers, antivirus, web services,\ndatabases, Active Directory, and domain name services. The combination of applicable STIGs\nand SRGs will result in a secure configuration to prevent issues such as insider threats, data\nexfiltration, or advanced persistent threats.\n\nIn order to better serve the needs of our DoD partners, and those who wish to meet the bar set by the DoD, VMware is providing three elements for community consumption and contribution.\n\n* STIG Readiness Guides\n  * SRG based content that is either the source material for an in process STIG, or that can be used in the absence of an official STIG.\n* Auditing Automation\n  * Automation to audit and report on the state of compliance for an associated set of SRG/STIG controls.\n* Remediation Automation\n  * Automation to remediate findings with a set of SRG/STIG controls using publicly accessible methods and APIs.\n\n## STIG Readiness Guides\nSTIG development is essentially an exercise where a specific product is filtered through all applicable SRGs to produce product-specific, NIST 800-53 backed hardening guidance. That content is then vetted, tested and approved by the DISA Risk Management Executive (RME) and posted on public.cyber.mil. VMware has a number of official STIGs published and we are working on many more. While we go through the official DISA vendor process, we want to make the SRG content available for public consumption and contributions while we wait for the official posting for products that are in process or are not scheduled to be submitted.\n\nFor more information on STIG Readiness Guides please read about our [STIG program](https://www.vmware.com/docs/vmw-stig-program-overview).\n\n__NOTE__: This project represents VMware's effort to document our compliance against the SRG requirements and nothing more. A published STIG is our eventual goal, in most cases, but this content should not be viewed to be \"as good as a STIG\". A DISA published STIG includes technical validation, review of requirement fulfillment, accuracy and style, risk acceptance and is digitally signed by the RME and posted on a .mil. This SRG content is intended to provided value to our partners while the STIGs are in process. Except for products that have published STIGs already, there is no explicit or implied DISA approval of the provided content.\n\n## Compliance Automation\nSTIG documents are written to be portable, offline hardening documentation where a sysadmin can go through, step by step, and STIG a system with no external dependencies. That said, many STIGs are either too complex or need to be applied to so many instances that manual steps are just not feasible. To augment the plain language STIG content, we are providing a number of ways to script or fully automate your VMware compliance activities.\n\n## Repo Structure\nAutomation provided here will be in the following structured format:  \n\n* Product\n  * Major Version\n    * README\n    * docs\n    * STIG Content Version\n\nFor example:\n* vsphere\n  * 8.0\n    * README\n    * docs\n    * v1r1-srg\n    * v1r1-stig\n\n*`srg` will denote STIG Readiness Guide content and `stig` will denote official STIG content*\n\n## Documentation\nDepending on the product, there may be a need to host DOD specific whitepapers, notes and addendums that have no other appropriate place. These items will be provided under the docs path where applicable.\n\n## Support\nMore information on support for STIGs and STIG Readiness Guides is available in the [Support](SUPPORT.md) document.\n\n## Archives\nThe `master` branch in this repo will contain only content for currently supported products. Access to older revisions of guidance and automation for products that are no longer supported and End of Life(EoL) will be available in the `archived_content` branch.  \n\n## Contributing\nThe dod-compliance-and-automation project team welcomes contributions from the community. If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our contributor license agreement (CLA), our bot will update the issue when you open a Pull Request. For any questions about the CLA process, please refer to our [FAQ](https://cla.vmware.com/faq).\n\n* __STIG Readiness Guides Content__ - VMware owns the state of the SRG/STIG controls provided here, including their applicability and how the requirements are addressed. That said, we are open to ideas for further hardening, additional methods, refinements, expansion, etc.\n\n* __Automation Content__ - VMware provides the automation content in a beta complete state. Once it is used by the broad github audience, we expect the need for refinements and we highly encourage feedback and direct contributions.\n\n## Disclaimer\nVMware accepts no liability for the consequences of applying specific configuration settings made on the basis of the SRGs/STIGs. It must be noted that the configuration settings specified should be evaluated in a local, representative test environment before implementation in a production environment, especially within large user populations. The extensive variety of environments makes it impossible to test these configuration settings for all potential software configurations.\n\nFor some production environments, failure to test before implementation may lead to a loss of required functionality. Evaluating the risks and benefits to a system’s particular circumstances and requirements is the system owner's responsibility. The evaluated risks resulting from not applying specified configuration settings must be approved by the responsible Authorizing Official.\n\nFurthermore, VMware implies no warranty that the application of all specified configurations will make a system 100 percent secure. Security guidance is provided for the Department of Defense. While other agencies and organizations are free to use it, care must be given to ensure that all applicable security guidance is applied both at the device hardening level as well as the architectural level. Some of the controls may not be configurable in environments outside the DoDIN.\n\n## License\nThe dod-compliance-and-automation project is available under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE).\n"]

These items will be provided under the docs path where applicable.\n\n## Support\nMore information on support for STIGs and STIG Readiness Guides is available in the [Support](SUPPORT.md) document.\n\n## Archives\nThe `master` branch in this repo will contain only content for currently supported products.

The validation is based genreally off the AWS guidance found here: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html>\n\n## Getting Started  \n\n__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ \n\nThe latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.  \n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to run the profile, you must install the following on the system you will be running inspec from so that the aws resources are able to connect and use the `aws api` to validate your RDS environment. Lastly, the IAM account used to run this profile against the AWS environment needs to be attached through a group or role with at least AWS IAM `ReadOnlyAccess` Managed Policy.\n\n- AWS CLI installed and configured\n- InSpec in your path\n- AWS IAM `ReadOnlyAccess` Managed Policy  \n\n### Configuring your AWS CLI\n\nBy default the InSpec AWS transport will use the default aws cli profile found in `~/.aws/` and the `SECRET` and `ACCESS` keys defined there.\n\nThe right system environment variables can be set with your AWS region and credentials and session token to use the AWS CLI and InSpec resources in a non-default AWS environment.

This [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) compliance profile verifies that you do not have any insecure or publicly accessible S3 buckets or bucket objects in your AWS environment in an automated way.\n\n## Required Gems\n\nThis profile requires the following gems:\n\n- `inspec` (v5 or higher)\n- `inspec-bin` (v5 or higher)\n- `aws-sdk-s3` (v2 or higher, v3 recommended)\n- `concurrent-ruby` (v1.1.0 or higher)\n\nPlease **install these gems** in the Ruby environment that InSpec is using before executing the profile.\n\n### Large Buckets and Profile Runtime\n\nThe `public-s3-bucket-objects` control - and its support library `list_public_s3_objects` - iterates through every object in each bucket in your AWS environment. The runtime will depend on the number of objects in your S3 buckets.\n\nOn average, the profile can process around ~1000 objects/sec.\n\nIf you have buckets with a large number of objects, we suggest scripting a loop and using the `single_bucket` input to parallelize the workload, or you can use the `test_buckets` input to provide an array of buckets to test.\n\n## Profile Inputs\n\n- `single_bucket`: The name of the single bucket you wish to scan. This input is useful for testing a specific bucket.\n- `exempt_buckets`: A list of buckets that should be exempted from review. This input allows you to skip certain buckets from being tested.\n- `test_buckets`: A list of buckets to test. This input allows you to specify multiple buckets to be tested.\n- `list_public_s3_objects_params`: A hash of parameters for the `list_public_s3_objects` function. This input allows you to configure the following parameters:\n  - `thread_pool_size`: The size of the thread pool for concurrent processing. Default is 50. Increasing this value can improve performance for buckets with a large number of objects by allowing more concurrent processing, but it may also increase the load on your system.\n  - `batch_size`: The number of objects to process in each batch. Default is 200. Adjusting this value can affect the balance between memory usage and processing speed.\n  - `max_retries`: The maximum number of retries for S3 requests. Default is 5. This can help handle transient errors but may increase the overall runtime if set too high.\n  - `retry_delay`: The delay between retries in seconds. Default is 0.5. This can help handle transient errors by spacing out retry attempts.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\n- **Threading and Concurrency**: The `thread_pool_size` parameter controls the number of concurrent threads used to process objects. Increasing this value can improve performance by allowing more objects to be processed simultaneously, but it may also increase the load on your system and potentially lead to throttling by AWS.\n- **Batch Processing**: The `batch_size` parameter controls the number of objects processed in each batch. Larger batch sizes can reduce the number of API calls to AWS, but they may also increase memory usage.\n- **Retries and Delays**: The `max_retries` and `retry_delay` parameters control how the function handles transient errors. Increasing the number of retries and the delay between retries can improve the robustness of the function but may also increase the overall runtime.\n\nTo see the processing in more detail, use the `-l debug` flag to get verbose output.\n\nYou can then load all your HDF JSON results into [Heimdall Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org) to easily review all your scan results from multiple runs by loading them in Heimdall.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIt is intended and recommended that InSpec and this profile be run from a **\"runner\"** host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely using **AWS CLI**.\n\n**For the best security of the runner, always install the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components on the runner.**\n\nThe latest versions and installation options are available on the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.\n\nThis baseline also requires the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), which is available on the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) site.\n\n### Getting MFA Aware AWS Access, Secret, and Session Tokens\n\nYou need to ensure that your AWS CLI environment has the correct system environment variables set with your AWS region, credentials, and session token to use the AWS CLI and InSpec resources in the AWS environment. InSpec supports the following standard AWS variables:\n\n- `AWS_REGION`\n- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\n- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`\n- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional) - required if MFA is enabled\n\n### Notes on MFA\n\nIn any AWS MFA-enabled environment, you need to use `derived credentials` to use the CLI. Your default `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` will not satisfy the MFA Policies in AWS environments.\n\nThe AWS documentation is available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-session-token.html).\n\nThe AWS profile documentation is available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html).\n\nA useful bash script for automating this is available [here](https://gist.github.com/dinvlad/d1bc0a45419abc277eb86f2d1ce70625).\n\nTo generate credentials using an AWS Profile, you will need to use the following AWS CLI commands:\n\na. `aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::<$YOUR-MFA-SERIAL> --token-code <$YOUR-CURRENT-MFA-TOKEN> --profile=<$YOUR-AWS-PROFILE>`\n\nb. Then export the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` that were generated by the above command.\n\n## Tailoring to Your Environment\n\nThe following inputs must be configured in an inputs \".yml\" file for the profile to run correctly in your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).\n\n```yaml\n# List of buckets exempted from inspection.\nexception_bucket_list:\n    - bucket1\n    - bucket2\n    ...\n\n# Test only one bucket\nsingle_bucket: 'my-bucket'\n\n# Test specific buckets\ntest_buckets:\n    - bucket3\n    - bucket4\n    ...\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n```bash\n# Set required ENV variables as per your environment\n\n$ export AWS_REGION=us-east-1\n$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...\n$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...\n$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=... # if MFA is enabled\n```\n\n## Installing the Needed Gems\n\n### Plain Old Ruby Environment\n\n- `gem install concurrent-ruby`\n\n### Using a Chef or CINC Omnibus Installation\n\n- `chef gem install concurrent-ruby`\n\n## Running This Baseline Directly from GitHub\n\n### Testing all your buckets except those defined in your `excluded buckets`\n\n`inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-s3-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target aws:// --input-file=your_inputs_file.yml --reporter=cli json:your_output_file.json`\n\n### Testing a single bucket\n\n`inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-s3-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target aws:// --input single_bucket=your_bucket --reporter=cli json:your_output_file.json`\n\n### Testing specific buckets\n\n`inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/aws-s3-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --target aws:// --input-file=your_inputs_file.yml --reporter=cli json:your_output_file.json`\n\n### Different Run Options\n\n[Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)\n\n## Running This Baseline from a Local Archive Copy\n\nIf your runner does not always have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this baseline and all its dependent tests:\n\n(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below.

More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).\n\n```yaml\ns3_name: '<name of s3 bucket>'\ns3_public: <bool>\ns3_versioning: <bool>\ns3_default_encryption: <bool>\ns3_access_logging: <bool>\n```\n\n# Running This Baseline from Github\n\n``` bash\n# How to run\ninspec exec https://github.com/Staggerlee011/s3-bp-benchmark/archive/master.tar.gz --t aws://<region>/<aws_credential_profile> --input-file=<inputs.yml> --reporter=cli json:s3-output.json\n```  \n\n### Different Run Options\n\n  [Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)  \n  \n## Using Heimdall for Viewing the JSON Results\n\nThe JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results.\n\nThe JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.\n\n## Authors\n\n* Staggerlee011\n\n\n## Special Thanks\n\n* MITRE SAF Team <https://saf.mitre.org>\n\n## Contributing and Getting Help\n\nTo report a bug or feature request, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Staggerlee011/s3-bp-benchmark/issues/new).\n"]

These guidelines are the primary security standards used by the DoD agencies. In addition to defining security guidelines, the STIGs also stipulate how security training should proceed and when security checks should occur. Organizations must stay compliant with these guidelines or they risk having their access to the DoD terminated.</p>\r\n<p>The RHEL9 STIG (see public.cyber.mil/stigs/) offers a comprehensive compliance guide for the configuration and operation your RedHat Enterprise Linux 9.x system.</p>\r\n<p>The requirements associated with the RHEL9 STIG are derived from the [Security Requirements Guides](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_requirements_guide) and align to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST) [Special Publication (SP) 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#!/800-53) Security Controls, [DoD Control Correlation Identifier](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/) and related standards.</p>\r\n<p>The RHEL9.x STIG profile checks were developed to provide technical implementation validation to the defined DoD requirements, the guidance can provide insight for any organizations wishing to enhance their security posture and can be tailored easily for use in your organization.</p>\r\n<p>### Source Guidance</p>\r\n<p>- RedHat Enterprise Linux 9 Security Technical Implementation Guide v2r4</p>\r\n<p>### Current Profile Statistics</p>\r\n<p>The profile will be tested on every commit and every release against both `vanilla` and `hardened` ubi and ec2 images using a CI/CD pipeline. The `vanilla` images are unmodified base images sourced from Red Hat itself. The `hardened` images have had their settings configured for security according to STIG guidance. Testing both vanilla and hardened configurations of both containerized and virtual machine implementations of RHEL9 is necessary to ensure the profile works in multiple environments.</p>\r\n<p>Further pipelines may be employed to test different hardening content sources (e.g., Ansible code sourced directly from DISA or Red Hat).</p>\r\n<p># Getting Started and Intended Usage</p>\r\n<p>1. It is intended and recommended that InSpec and the profile be run from a **\"runner\"** host, either from source or a local archieve - [Running the Profile](#running-the-profile) - (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target [ remotely over **ssh**].</p>\r\n<p>2. **For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.**</p>\r\n<p>3. The latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.</p>\r\n<p>4. Always use the latest version of the `released profile` (see below) on your system.</p>\r\n<p>## Intended Usage - `main` vs `releases`</p>\r\n<p>1. The latest `released` version of the profile is intended for use in A&amp;A testing, as well as providing formal results to Authorizing Officials and IAMs. Please use the `released` versions of the profile in these types of workflows.</p>\r\n<p>2. The `main` branch is a development branch that will become the next release of the profile. The `main` branch is intended for use in _developing and testing_ merge requests for the next release of the profile, and _is not intended_ be used for formal and ongoing testing on systems.</p>\r\n<p>## Environment Aware Testing</p>\r\n<p>The RHEL9.x STIG profile is `container aware` and is able to determine when the profile is being executed inside or outside a `docker container` and will only run the tests that are approporate for the enviroment it is testing in. The tests are all tagged as `host` or `host, container`.</p>\r\n<p>All the profile's tests (`controls`) apply to the `host` but many of the controls are `Not Applicable` when running inside a `docker container` (such as, for example, controls that test the system's GUI). When running inside a `docker container`, the tests that only applicable to the host will be marked as `Not Applicable` automatically.</p>\r\n<p>## Tailoring to Your Environment</p>\r\n<p>### Profile Inputs (see `inspec.yml` file)</p>\r\n<p>This profile uses InSpec Inputs to make the tests more flexible. You are able to provide inputs at runtime either via the cli or via YAML files to help the profile work best in your deployment.</p>\r\n<p>#### **_Do not change the inputs in the `inspec.yml` file_**</p>\r\n<p>The `inputs` configured in the `inspec.yml` file are **profile definition and defaults for the profile** and not for the user. InSpec provides two ways to adjust the profiles inputs at run-time that do not require modifiying `inspec.yml` itself. This is because automated profiles like this one are frequently run from a script, inside a pipeline or some kind of task scheduler. Such automation usually works by running the profile directly from its source (i.e. this repository), which means the runner will not have access to the `inspec.yml`.</p>\r\n<p>To tailor the tested values for your deployment or organizationally defined values, **_you may update the inputs_**.</p>\r\n<p>#### Update Profile Inputs from the CLI or Local File</p>\r\n<p>1. Via the cli with the `--input` flag<br>2. Pass them in a YAML file with the `--input-file` flag.</p>\r\n<p>More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Inputs Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/inputs/).</p>\r\n<p>#### See the `inspec.yml` file for full list of available inputs</p>\r\n<p>Example Inputs</p>\r\n<p>```yaml<br>&nbsp; TODO<br>```</p>\r\n<p># Running the Profile</p>\r\n<p>## (connected) Running the Profile Directly</p>\r\n<p>```<br>inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline/archive/main.tar.gz --input-file=&lt;your_inputs_file.yml&gt; -t ssh://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt; --sudo --reporter=cli json:&lt;your_results_file.json&gt;<br>```</p>\r\n<p>## (disconnected) Running the profile from a local archive copy</p>\r\n<p>If your runner is not always expected to have direct access to the profile's hosted location, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this overlay and all of its dependent tests:</p>\r\n<p>(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.)</p>\r\n<p>When the **\"runner\"** host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps:</p>\r\n<p>```<br>mkdir profiles<br>cd profiles<br>git clone https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline.git<br>inspec archive redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline<br>&lt;sneakerNet your archive&gt;<br>inspec exec &lt;name of generated archive&gt; --input-file=&lt;your_inputs_file.yml&gt; -t ssh://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt; --sudo --reporter=cli json:&lt;your_results_file.json&gt;<br>```</p>\r\n<p>For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this overlay and dependent profiles:</p>\r\n<p>1. Delete and recreate your archive as shown above<br>2. Update your archive with the following steps</p>\r\n<p>```<br>cd redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline<br>git pull<br>cd ..<br>inspec archive redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline<br>```</p>\r\n<p>## Different Run Options</p>\r\n<p>[Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)</p>\r\n<p># Using Heimdall for Viewing Test Results and Exporting for Checklist and eMASS</p>\r\n<p>The JSON results output file can be loaded into **[Heimdall](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)** for a user-interactive, graphical view of the profile scan results. Heimdall-Lite is a `browser only` viewer that allows you to easily view your results directly and locally rendered in your browser.</p>\r\n<p>It can also **_export your results into a DISA Checklist (CKL) file_** for easily upload into eMass using the `Heimdall Export` function.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on your enviroment, you can also use the [SAF CLI](https://saf-cli.mitre.org) to run a local docker instance of heimdall-lite via the `saf view:heimdall` command.</p>\r\n<p>The JSON results file may also be loaded into a **[full Heimdall Server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)**, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.</p>\r\n<p>You can deploy your own instances of Heimdall-Lite or Heimdall Server easily via docker, kurbernetes, or the installation packages.</p>\r\n<p># Authors</p>\r\n<p>Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) &lt;https://www.disa.mil/&gt;</p>\r\n<p>STIG support by DISA Risk Management Team and Cyber Exchange &lt;https://public.cyber.mil/&gt;</p>\r\n<p>MITRE Security Automation Framework Team &lt;https://saf.mitre.org&gt;</p>\r\n<p>### NOTICE</p>\r\n<p>DISA STIGs are published by DISA IASE, see: &lt;https://iase.disa.mil/Pages/privacy_policy.aspx&gt;</p>"]
